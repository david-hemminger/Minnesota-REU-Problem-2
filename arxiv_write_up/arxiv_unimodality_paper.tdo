\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Make a remark about a Generalization of $\EuScript H,\EuScript E$}{12}{section*.3}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ We can reference our other paper online, or perhaps find a better reference for this? In the other paper, we said: This is a well known fact, proven later in Lemma \ref {lem:young_diag_reps}. Z: Do we really need it? It depends on which journal to send to, I think once Vic mentioned that most people know what the wreath product of symmetric groups ``look like'', especially so in this field?}{17}{section*.4}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Make some comment about Polya theory here, or elsewhere perhaps, with reference to our full paper}{18}{section*.5}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Why is point 2 being singled out in this remark? Doesn't Peckness apply to all three actions from proposition 1.6? Z: Did someone add this remark? I think it is weird to single out point 2 as well.}{23}{section*.6}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Why does it say ungraded here in parentheses? It's actually an endofunctor on graded posets. Are you trying to indicate that it is both an endofunctor on graded posets and ungraded posets. If you are, you should write out both. I.e., it determines an endofunctor on graded posets, as well as on the full category of posets.}{30}{section*.7}
