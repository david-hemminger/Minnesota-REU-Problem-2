\begin{abstract}
For any graded poset $P,$ we define a new graded poset, $\mathcal E(P),$ whose elements are the edges in the Hasse diagram of P. For any group, $G,$ acting on the boolean algebra, $B_n,$ we conjecture that $\mathcal E(B_n/G)$ is Peck. We prove that the conjecture holds for ``common cover transitive'' actions. We give some infinite families of common cover transitive actions and show that the common cover transitive actions are closed under direct and semidirect products. We also prove that $\mathcal E(B_n/G)$ is unimodal and symmetric in the case that $G$ is a cyclic group or dihedral group.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Let $P$ be a finite graded poset of rank $n$.  In this paper we study the structure of the edges in the Hasse diagram of $P$.  To this end, we define an endofunctor $\mathcal{E}$ on the category of finite graded posets with rank-preserving morphisms as follows

\begin{defn}
\label{defn:functor_of_edges}
For $\mathcal P$ the category of graded posets, define the {\it functor of edges} $\mathcal{E}\colon\mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}$ as follows. The elements of the graded poset $\mathcal{E}(P)$ are pairs $(x, y)$ where $x,y\in P$, $x\le_P y$, and $\rk(y) = \rk(x) + 1$. Define the covering relation $\lessdot_{\mathcal{E}}$ on $\mathcal{E}(P)$ by $(x, y) \lessdot_{\mathcal{E}} (x^\prime, y^\prime)$ if $x\lessdot_P x^\prime$ and $y\lessdot_P y^\prime$. Then define the relation $\le_{\mathcal{E}}$ on $\mathcal{E}(P)$ to be the transitive closure of $\lessdot_{\mathcal{E}}$.

Let $Q$ be a finite graded poset of rank $n$. Given a morphism $f\colon P\rightarrow Q$, define $\mathcal{E}(f)\colon \mathcal{E}(P)\rightarrow \mathcal{E}(Q)$ by $\mathcal{E}(f)(x,y) = (f(x), f(y))$.
\end{defn}


%\begin{defn}
%\label{defn:functor_of_edges}
%For $P$ a finite graded poset, define its graded \textit{edge poset} $\mathcal{E}(P)$ as follows.  The elements of $\mathcal E(P)$ are pairs $(x,y)$ where $x,y\in P$, $x\le_P y$, and $\rk(y) = \rk(x) + 1$. Define the covering relation $\lessdot_{\mathcal E}$ on $\mathcal E(P)$ by $(x, y) \lessdot_{\mathcal E} (x^\prime, y^\prime)$ if $x\lessdot_P x^\prime$ and $y\lessdot_P y^\prime$, and define the relation $\le_{\mathcal E}$ on $\mathcal E(P)$ to be the transitive closure of $\lessdot_{\mathcal E}$.  Finally define a rank function on $\mathcal{E}(P)$ by $\rk_{\mathcal{E}(P)}(x,y) = \rk_P(x)$.
%\end{defn}
%Let $Q$ be a finite graded poset of rank $n$.  Given a morphism $f\colon P\rightarrow Q$, define $\mathcal E(f)\colon \mathcal E(P)\rightarrow \mathcal E(Q)$ by $\mathcal E(f)(x,y) = (f(x), f(y))$.


We will show that $\mathcal{E}(P)$ is a well-defined graded poset in Section \ref{sec:functor_of_edges}.  Note that since an edge in the Hasse diagram of $P$ can be identified with a pair $(x,y)\in P\times P$ such that $x\lessdot y$, the edges in the Hasse diagram are in bijection with elements $(x,y)\in \mathcal E(P)$ via this identification.  With this in mind, we will frequently refer to $\mathcal{E}(P)$ as the {\it edge poset} of $P$. 

\begin{eg}
We give an example of an edge poset in Figure \ref{fig:EP_definition_example}.  Note that it is important we declare the relation $\leq_\mathcal E$ to be the transitive closure of $\lessdot_{\mathcal E}$.  If instead we defined a relation $\le_{\mathcal{E^\prime}}$ on $\mathcal{E}(P)$ by $(x, y) \leq (a, b)$ if $x \leq a, y \leq b$, then $\mathcal{E}(P)$ would not necessarily be a graded poset.  In Figure \ref{fig:EP_definition_example} we give an example of a poset $P$ for which $\mathcal{E}(P)$ is not graded with the relation $\le_{\mathcal{E^\prime}}$.  In the figure it is clear that $\mathcal E(P)$ is a graded poset, with $\rk(x,y) = \rk(x),$ but the Hasse diagram on the right represents a poset which does not have a grading.

%On the left hand side is the Hasse diagram of a poset $P$ in the middle is the poset $\mathcal E(P)$ and on the right hand side is the poset obtained from the relation

We observe that when $P$ has a nice structure, $\mathcal E(P)$ commonly has a nice structure as well.  In particular we examine the \textit{boolean algebra of rank $n$}, denoted $B_n$, which is defined to be the poset whose elements are subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ with the relation given by containment, i.e. for all $x,y\in B_n$, $x\le y$ if $x$ is a subset of $y$.

Throughout the paper we say a group $G$ acts on $P$ if it acts on the elements of $P$ and that action is order-preserving and rank-preserving, i.e. for all $g \in G$ we have $x \leq y \iff gx \leq gy$ and $\rk(gx) = \rk(x)$.  By Theorem \ref{thm:quotients_of_unitary_peck_posets} and the fact that $B_n$ is unitary peck, if $G$ is any action on $B_n,$ then $B_n/G$ is Peck.  We conjecture the following.

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:F_of_BnG_Peck}
If $G \subseteq Aut(B_n)$, then $\mathcal E(B_n/G)$ is Peck.
\end{conjecture}

We prove this conjecture holds whenever the group action of $G$ on $B_n$ has the following property.

\begin{defn}
\label{defn:cover_transitive}
A group action of $G$ on $P$ is \textit{common cover transitive} (CCT) if whenever $x,y,z\in P$ such that $x\lessdot z$, $y\lessdot z$, and $y\in Gx$ there exists some $g\in Stab(z)$ such that $g\cdot x = y.$
\end{defn}

\begin{restatable}{thm}{cctpeck}
\label{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck}
If a group action of $G$ on $B_n$ is CCT, then $\mathcal E(B_n/G)$ is Peck.
\end{restatable}

A large number of group actions on $B_n$ have the CCT property.  We first prove that some basic group actions on $B_n$ are CCT.  Throughout the paper we let a subgroup $G\subseteq S_n$ act on $B_n$ by letting it act on the elements within subsets of $[n]:= \{1,\ldots, n\}$, i.e. $g\cdot x = \{g\cdot i\colon i\in x\}$  for all $g\in G$, $x\in B_n$.  We also embed the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ into $S_n$ by letting it act on the vertices of an $n$-gon.

\begin{restatable}{prop}{building}
\label{prop:cover_transitive_building_blocks}
Let $p$ be prime.  The following actions are CCT.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The action of $S_n$ on $B_n$.
\item The action of $D_{2p}$ on $B_p$.
\item The action of $D_{4p}$ on $B_{2p}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{restatable}

We then show that cover transitivity is preserved under semidirect products, allowing us to describe several large families of CCT actions in Section \ref{ssec:CCT_examples}.

\begin{restatable}{prop}{semidirect}
\label{prop:semidirect_product_preservation}
Let $G\subseteq \operatorname{Aut}(P)$, $H\triangleleft G$, $K\subset G$ such that $G = H\rtimes K$.  Suppose that the action of $H$ is on $P$ is CCT and the action of $K$ on $P/H$ is CCT. Then the action of $G$ on $P$ is CCT.
\end{restatable}

The paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:background} we cover the necessary background for posets and Peck posets.  In Section \ref{sec:functor_of_edges} we show that $\mathcal E$ is well-defined and prove Theorem \ref{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck} regarding CCT actions along with various other nice properties of $\mathcal E$. Section \ref{sec:cover_transitive} contains the proofs of Propositions \ref{prop:cover_transitive_building_blocks} and \ref{prop:semidirect_product_preservation} as well as some examples of families of group actions shown to be CCT by these propositions. In Section \ref{sec:wreath_product}, we obtain a very different proof of \cite[Theorem 1.1]{pak}, in the case that $r = 1$. In Section \ref{sec:unimodal} we prove that $\mathcal E(B_n/G)$ is rank-unimodal for certain group actions that are not CCT. Then, in Section \ref{sec:unitary_peck_f}, we give a computational proof that $\mathcal E(B_n)$ is unitary Peck, and describe additional aspects of this problem as well as further questions.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Background   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Background}\label{sec:background}
In this section we review necessary background for this paper. 
%morphisms of graded posets, Peck posets, and a useful theorem about quotients of posets. 

A {\it graded poset} $P$ is a poset with a rank function $\rk:P \rightarrow \mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$ satisfying the following conditions.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $x\in P_i$ and $x\lessdot y$, then $rk(x) + 1 = \rk(y),$
  \item If $x < y$ then $\rk(x) < \rk(y)$ 
\end{enumerate}

Define the $i$th rank of $P$ to be  $P_i = \{x \in P\colon\rk(x) = i\}.$ Additionally, if for all $x\in P,0 \leq \rk(x) \leq n,$ and there exists $x,y$ with $\rk(x) = 0, \rk(y) = n,$ we say $P$ is a graded poset of {\it rank $n$}.

Denote the category of finite graded posets by $\mathcal{P}$, and let $P,Q$ be finite graded posets.  Throughout the paper we write $x\le_P y$ to denote that $x$ is less than or equal to $y$ under the relation defined on the poset $P$.  When the poset is clear we will omit the $P$ and simply write $x\le y$.  

A map $f\colon P\rightarrow Q$ is a \textit{morphism} from $P$ to $Q$ if it is rank-preserving and order preserving, i.e. for all $x,y\in P$, $x\le_P y \Rightarrow f(x)\le_Q f(y)$ and $\rk(x) = \rk(f(x))$.  We say that $f$ is \textit{injective/surjective/bijective} if it is an injection/surjection/bijection from $P$ to $Q$ as sets.

\begin{rem}\label{rem:bijective_morphism_not_isomorphism}
Note that we do not require the implication $f(x)\le_Q f(y) \Rightarrow x\le_P y$ in order for $f$ to be a morphism.  In particular this means a bijective morphism $f$ need not be an isomorphism, since it will not necessarily have a two-sided inverse.  
%There is an important distinction here between bijection and isomorphism. Another way to describe a bijection is that it is an embedding $f:P\rightarrow Q$ which is a bijection on the sets of vertices of $P,Q$. But, an isomorphism also defines a bijection between the edges of the two posets as well.
\end{rem}


In what follows, let $P$ be a poset of rank $n$. Write $p_i = |P_i|$.  If we have

$$p_0\le p_1\le \ldots \le p_k \ge p_{k+1} \ge\ldots \ge p_n$$

\noindent for some $0\le k\le n$, then $P$ is \textit{rank-unimodal}. If $p_i = p_{n-i}$ for all $1\le i\le n,$ then $P$ is \textit{rank-symmetric}.  An \textit{antichain} in $P$ is a set of elements in $P$ that are pairwise incomparable.  If no antichain in $P$ is larger than the largest rank of $P$, then $P$ is \textit{Sperner}.  More generally, $P$ is \textit{$k$-Sperner} if no union of $k$ antichains in $P$ is larger than the union of the largest $k$ ranks of $P$. We say $P$ is \textit{strongly Sperner} if it is $k$-Sperner for all $1\le k\le n$.

\begin{defn}
$P$ is \textit{Peck} if $P$ is rank-symmetric, rank-unimodal, and strongly Sperner.
\end{defn}


Let $V(P)$ and $V(P_i)$ be the complex vector spaces with bases $\{x :x\in P\}$ and $\{x :x\in P_i\}$ respectively.  Note that we will frequently abuse notation and write $P$ and $P_i$ for $V(P)$ and $V(P_i)$ when what we mean is clear from context.  In determining whether $P$ is Peck, it is often useful to consider certain linear transformations on $V(P)$.

\begin{defn}
\label{defn:lefschetz}
A linear map $U\colon V(P)\rightarrow V(P)$ is an \textit{order-raising operator} if $U(V(P_n)) = 0$ and for all $0\le i\le n-1$, $x\in P_i$ we have

$$U(x) = \sum_{y\gtrdot x} c_{x,y}y$$

\noindent for some constants $c_{x,y}\in \mathbb{C}$.  We say that $U$ is the \textit{Lefschetz map} if all $c_{x,y}$ on the right hand side are equal to 1.
\end{defn}

\noindent We then have the following well-known characterization of Peck posets.

\begin{lem}[\cite{weyl_groups_stanley}, Lemma 1.1]\label{lem:Peck_poset_characterization}
$P$ is Peck if and only if there exists an order-raising operator $U$ such that for all $0\le i < \frac{n}{2}$, the map $U^{n-2i}\colon V(P_i)\rightarrow V(P_{n-i})$ is an isomorphism.
\end{lem}

\begin{defn}
If the Lefschetz map satisfies the condition for $U$ in Lemma \ref{lem:Peck_poset_characterization}, then $P$ is \textit{unitary Peck}.
\end{defn}


We say that a group $G$ acts on $P$ if the action defines and embedding $G\hookrightarrow \operatorname{Aut}(P)$, and define the \textit{quotient poset} $P/G$ to be the poset whose elements are the orbits of $G$, with the relation $\mathcal{O}\le \mathcal{O}^\prime$ if there exist $x\in \mathcal{O}$, $x^\prime\in \mathcal{O}^\prime$ such that $x\le x^\prime$.  We will use the following result later in the paper.

\begin{thm}[\cite{quotients_stanley}, Theorem 1]
\label{thm:quotients_of_unitary_peck_posets}
If $P$ is unitary Peck and $G\subseteq\operatorname{Aut}(P)$, then $P/G$ is Peck.
\end{thm}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The Edge Functor  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{The Edge Poset Construction}
\label{sec:functor_of_edges}

In subsection \ref{ssec:definition_and_basic_properties} we show that $\mathcal E$ as described in Definition \ref{defn:functor_of_edges} is well-defined and prove some useful properties of $\mathcal E$.  Subsection \ref{ssec:proof_of_cover_transitive_implies_Peck} is devoted to the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck}.


\ssec{Definition and Basic Properties}

\label{ssec:definition_and_basic_properties}
First we show that $\mathcal{E}$ is well-defined in Lemmas \ref{lem:f_partial_order} and \ref{lem:FP_graded_poset}.  After showing that $\mathcal E$ is well-defined we then define a natural $G$ action on $\mathcal E(P)$ and define a surjection $\mathcal E(P)/G\rightarrow \mathcal E(P/G)$ that will be important for the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck}. Then, we prove the simple result that $\mathcal E$ sends self-dual posets to self-dual posets. Finally, we note several equivalent definitions of CCT actions.

\ssec{Functoriality of $\mathcal E$ and Group Actions}

When the poset $P$ is clear, we will use $\leq_{\mathcal E}$ and $\lessdot_{\mathcal E}$ to refer to $\leq_{\mathcal E(P)}$ and $\lessdot_{\mathcal E(P)}$. Similarly, in Subsection ~\ref{ssec:proof_of_cover_transitive_implies_Peck}, we define posets $\mathcal H(B_n),$ and will use $\leq_{\mathcal H}$ and $\lessdot_{\mathcal H}$ in place of $\leq_{\mathcal H(B_n)}$ and $\lessdot_{\mathcal H(B_n)}$.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:f_partial_order}
The relation $\le_{\mathcal E}$ defines a partial order on $\mathcal E(P)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
We have that $(x, y)\le_{\mathcal E} (x, y)$ and that $\le_{\mathcal E}$ is transitive by definition.  It remains to be shown that $\le_{\mathcal E}$ is antisymmetric.  Suppose $(x, y)\le_{\mathcal E} (x^\prime, y^\prime)$ and $(x^\prime, y^\prime)\le_{\mathcal E} (x, y)$.  Then $x\le_P x^\prime \le_P x$ and $y\le_P y^\prime \le_P y$, so $x = x^\prime$ and $y=y^\prime$ by antisymmetry of $\le_P$, hence $(x, y) = (x^\prime, y^\prime)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:FP_graded_poset}
For $P$ a graded poset, the object $\mathcal E(P)$ is a graded poset.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
To show $\mathcal E(P)$ is graded, we must show that $(x, y) \lessdot_{\mathcal E} (x^\prime, y^\prime) \implies \rk(x, y)+1 = \rk(x^\prime , y^\prime)$.  This fact follows immediately from the definition of $\lessdot_{\mathcal E}$ and the definition $\rk_{\mathcal E}(x, y) = \rk_P(x)$.
\end{proof}

%First, if $x\otimes y <_{\mathcal E} a \otimes b$ then by definition of $<_{\mathcal E}$, we must have $x < x^\prime,$ and hence 
%$$\rk_{\mathcal E}(x\otimes y) = \rk_P(x)<rk_P(x^\prime) = \rk_{\mathcal E}(x^\prime\otimes y^\prime).$$
%Second, if $x\otimes y \lessdot_{\mathcal H} x^\prime \otimes y^\prime$ then $x \lessdot_P x^\prime,$ so $\rk(x)+1 = \rk(x^\prime)$ and then $$\rk_{\mathcal E}(x\otimes y)+1 = \rk_P(x) +1=rk_P(x^\prime)= \rk_{\mathcal E}(x^\prime\otimes y^\prime).$$



In order to define a group action, we will define more generally a way for morphisms of posets to induce morphisms of their edge posets.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:Ff_poset_morphism}
Let $f\colon P\rightarrow Q$ be a morphism of finite graded posets, and define a map $\mathcal E(f)\colon \mathcal E(P)\rightarrow \mathcal E(Q)$ by $\mathcal{E}(f)(x,y) = (f(x),f(y))$ for all $(x,y)\in \mathcal{E}(P)$.  Then

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{E}(f)$ is a morphism of finite graded posets
\item $\mathcal{E}(\id_P) = \id_{\mathcal{E}(P)}$
\item If $g\colon Q\rightarrow R$ is a morphism of finite graded posets, then $\mathcal E(g\circ f) = \mathcal E(g)\circ\mathcal E(f)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} \indent

\vskip.1in
\noindent
{\sf Part (1)}
First, $\mathcal E(f)$ is rank-preserving, since for all $(x, y)\in \mathcal E(P)$ we have 
$$\rk_{\mathcal E}(x, y) = \rk_P(x) = \rk_P(f(x)) = \rk_{\mathcal E}(\mathcal E(f)(x, y)).$$
Suppose $(x, y)\lessdot_{\mathcal E} (x^\prime, y^\prime)$.  Then $x\lessdot_P x^\prime$, $y\lessdot_P y^\prime$, and since $f$ is order-preserving, it follows that $f(x)\lessdot_P f(x^\prime)$, $f(y)\lessdot_P f(y^\prime)$. Hence $\mathcal E(f)(x,y) \lessdot_{\mathcal E} \mathcal E(f)(x^\prime , y^\prime)$. Since $\le_{\mathcal E}$ is the transitive closure of $\lessdot_{\mathcal E}$, we similarly obtain $\mathcal E(f)$ is order-preserving and hence a morphism of finite graded posets.

\vskip.1in
\noindent
{\sf Part (2)} This is trivial.

\vskip.1in
\noindent
{\sf Part (3)} For all $(x, y)\in \mathcal E(P)$ we have 
$$\mathcal E(g\circ f)(x, y) = (g(f(x)), g(f(y))) = \left(\mathcal E(g)\circ\mathcal E(f)\right)(x, y).$$
\end{proof}

%\begin{prop}\label{prop:F_well_defined}
%The map $\mathcal E(P)$ is an endofunctor on the category of finite graded posets $\mathcal{P}$.
%\end{prop}
%
%\begin{proof}
%By Lemmas \ref{lem:f_partial_order}, \ref{lem:FP_graded_poset}, and \ref{lem:Ff_poset_morphism} we have that $\mathcal E$ takes objects in $\mathcal{P}$ to objects in $\mathcal{P}$ and morphisms of $\mathcal{P}$ to morphisms of $\mathcal{P}$.  Furthermore it is clear that $\mathcal E(\id_P) = \id_{\mathcal E(P)}$, so it remains to be shown that for finite graded posets $P, Q,$ and $R$ with morphisms $f\colon P\rightarrow Q$ and $g\colon Q\rightarrow R$ that $\mathcal E(g\circ f) = \mathcal E(g)\circ\mathcal E(f)$.  This is clear, however, as for all $(x, y)\in \mathcal E(P)$ we have $\mathcal E(g\circ f)(x, y) = (g(f(x)), g(f(y))) = \left(\mathcal E(g)\circ\mathcal E(f)\right)(x, y)$.
%\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
By Lemma \ref{lem:Ff_poset_morphism}, the edge poset construction $\mathcal{E}$ defines an endofunctor on the category finite graded posets with rank-preserving morphisms.
\end{rem}



Given a group action of $G$ on $P$, we can now easily define a natural group action of $G$ on $\mathcal E(P)$ using Lemma \ref{lem:Ff_poset_morphism}.  For all $g\in G$ we have that multiplication by $g$ is an automorphism of $P$, so it follows that $\mathcal E(g)$ is an automorphism of $\mathcal E(P)$ and furthermore that this gives a well-defined group action by Lemma \ref{lem:Ff_poset_morphism}.

\begin{defn}\label{note:G_action_on_FP}
Given a $G$-action on $P$, define a $G$-action on $\mathcal E(P)$ by $g\cdot (x,y) = \mathcal{E}(g)(x,y) = (gx,gy)$.
\end{defn}

We then have a well-defined quotient poset $\mathcal E(P)/G$.  It is natural to ask whether the operation of quotienting out by $G$ commutes with $\mathcal E$, that is, whether $\mathcal E(P/G) \cong \mathcal E(P)/G$.  Unfortunately the two posets are rarely isomorphic, but there is always a surjection $\mathcal E(P)/G\rightarrow \mathcal E(P/G)$, and this surjection is also an injection precisely when the $G$-action on $P$ is CCT, as will be shown in Lemma \ref{lem:cover_transitive_equivalence}.


\begin{prop}\label{prop:surjection_between_F_quotients}
%For any group $G$ acting on $P$ and $0\le i\le \rk(P)$, we have $|\mathcal E(P/G)|_i \le |\mathcal E(P)/G|_i$.
The map $q\colon \mathcal E(P)/G\rightarrow \mathcal E(P/G)$ defined by $q(G(x, y)) = (Gx,Gy)$ is a surjective morphism.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
%Let $Gx\otimes Gy\in \mathcal E(P/G)$.  Since the orbits between $Gx$ and $Gy$ form a boolean algebra of size $r$, it is possible to pick a set of representatives from the orbits in $Gx\otimes Gy$ such that the representatives form a boolean subalgebra $x\otimes y$ of size $r$ in $P$.  Then $x\otimes y\in \mathcal E(P)$ and the orbit $G(x\otimes y)$ is in $\mathcal E(P)/G$.  Furthermore, if $Gy^\prime\otimes Gx^\prime \ne Gy\otimes Gx$, then any boolean subalgebra $x^\prime\otimes y^\prime$ given by representatives from orbits lying between $Gx^\prime$ and $Gy^\prime$ will not be an element of $G(x\otimes y)$, since $(Gx,Gy)\ne (Gx^\prime,Gy^\prime)$.  Thus a choice of representatives from each boolean subalgebra of size $r$ in $\mathcal E(P/G)$ gives a rank-preserving injection $\mathcal E(P/G)\rightarrow \mathcal E(P)/G$ and hence $|\mathcal E(P/G)|_i \le |\mathcal E(P)/G|_i$.

%Now consider the case when $r = 1$.  A boolean subalgebra of size 1 simply corresponds to an edge between adjacent ranks defined by a covering relation $x\lessdot y$ for some $x,y\in P$.  Then for every edge $x\otimes y\in \mathcal E(P)$, the orbit $Gx\otimes Gy$ is an element of $\mathcal E(P/G)$, so we get a map $q\colon \mathcal E(P)/G \rightarrow \mathcal E(P/G)$ by defining $q(G(x\otimes y)) = Gx\otimes Gy$. 


Note that $q$ is well defined because if $(x^\prime, y^\prime) = g(x, y) = (g\cdot x, g\cdot y)$ for some $g\in G$, then $x^\prime\in Gx$ and $y^\prime\in Gy$.  Clearly $q$ is rank-preserving and surjective, so it suffices to show that $q$ is order-preserving.  Suppose that $G(x, y) \lessdot_{\mathcal E(P)/G} G(w, z)$.  Then there exist some $(x_0, y_0)\in G(x, y)$, $(w_0, z_0)\in G(w, z)$ such that $x_0\lessdot_P w_0$ and $y_0\lessdot_P z_0$.  We then have that $(Gx, Gy) \lessdot_{\mathcal E(P/G)} (Gw, Gz)$ by definition. Since $\le_{\mathcal E(P/G)}$ is the transitive closure of $\lessdot_{\mathcal E(P/G)}$, $q$ is order-preserving.
\end{proof}

\ssec{The Opposite Functor and Self Dual Posets}

Next, we introduce the notion of a dual poset, given by applying the opposite functor, op, to a graded poset. We will show $op$ commutes with $\mathcal E.$ This will imply $\mathcal E(P)$ is self-dual if $P$ is, which, in turn, will imply $\mathcal E(B_n/G)$ is self-dual for any group action of $G$ on $B_n$.

\begin{defn}
Let $\mathcal P$ be the category of graded posets and let $op:\mathcal P \rightarrow \mathcal P$ be the opposite functor, defined on posets as follows. For $P$ a poset, the elements of $P^{op}$ are the same as those of $P$ with order relation $\le_{P^{op}}$ defined by $x \leq_{P^{op}} y \iff x \geq_P y.$ Induced maps on morphisms are given as follows: for $P,Q$ graded posets with $f:P \rightarrow Q,$ then $f^{op}:P^{op} \rightarrow Q^{op}$ is defined by $f^{op}(x) = f(x).$ The poset $P^{op}$ is called the {\it dual} poset of $P$. A poset $P$ is {\it self-dual} if there is an isomorphism of posets $P \cong P^{op}.$
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
Note that it is easy to check $op:\mathcal P \rightarrow \mathcal P$ is indeed a covariant functor. In more abstract terms, if we view $P$ as a category, $P^{op}$ is the opposite category. Additionally, $op$ as defined in this way is actually a endofunctor on the category of all finite posets, which restricts to a functor on the subcategory of graded posets.
\end{rem}

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:commuting_op_e}
The functor $op:\mathcal P \rightarrow \mathcal P$ commutes with the functor $\mathcal E:\mathcal P \rightarrow \mathcal P.$ That is, $\mathcal E(P^{op}) \cong \mathcal E(\mathcal P)^{op}.$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Observe that $\mathcal E(P^{op})$ is canonically isomorphic to $\mathcal E(P)^{op},$ as given by the morphism $F:\mathcal E(P^{op}) \rightarrow \mathcal E(P)^{op},(x,y) \mapsto (x,y).$ The inverse to $F$ is given by $G:\mathcal E(P)^{op} \rightarrow \mathcal E(P^{op}),(x,y)\mapsto (x,y).$ These maps are well defined because $\mathcal E(P)^{op}$ and $\mathcal E(P^{op})$ are the same as sets, and it follows from the definitions that these are both morphisms of graded posets, and so $F$ defines an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:self_dual_preservation}
If $P$ is a self-dual poset, then $\mathcal E(P)$ is also self-dual.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Since $P$ is self-dual, there is an isomorphism $f:P \rightarrow P^{op}.$ By functoriality of $\mathcal E$, as shown in Lemma \ref{lem:Ff_poset_morphism}, we obtain that $\mathcal E(f):\mathcal E(P) \rightarrow \mathcal E(P^{op})$ is an isomorphism. By Lemma \ref{lem:commuting_op_e}, there is an isomorphism $\mathcal E(P^{op}) \cong \mathcal E(P)^{op}.$ Then, letting $F:\mathcal E(P^{op}) \rightarrow \mathcal E(P)^{op},(x,y) \mapsto (x,y)$ be the same isomorphism defined in the proof of
\ref{lem:commuting_op_e}, the composition $F\circ \mathcal E(f):\mathcal E(P) \rightarrow \mathcal E(P)^{op}$ defines an isomorphism, so $\mathcal E(P)$ is self-dual.
\end{proof}


\begin{eg}
While $\mathcal{E}(P)$ is commonly Peck when $P$ is Peck, $\mathcal E(P)$ need not be Peck in general.  Furthermore, adding the condition that $P$ be self-dual does not change this fact.  In Figure \ref{fig:dual_not_unimodal} we give an example of a poset $P$ such that $P$ is unitary Peck and self-dual, but $\mathcal{E}(P)$ is not rank-unimodal, hence not Peck.

\begin{rem}
\label{rem:induced_action_bn}
Whenever there is an action $\psi:G \times [n] \rightarrow [n],$ we obtain an induced action $\phi: G \times B_n \rightarrow B_n$ defined by
$$\phi(g,\{x_1,\ldots, x_k\}) = \{\psi(g,x_1),\ldots, \psi(g,x_k)\}.$$
It is easy to see that any action $\phi:G \times B_n \rightarrow B_n$ arises in this way. That is, for any action $\phi$ of $G$ on $B_n$ there exists an action $\psi$ of $G$ on $[n]$ such that $\phi(g,\{x_1,\ldots, x_k\}) = \{\psi(g,x_1),\ldots, \psi(g,x_k)\}.$ This fact, that all actions on $B_n$ are induced by actions on $[n]$ follows from the more general fact about atomic lattices. Recall, $L$ is an atomic lattice if there exists a minimum element of $L$ and a subset of $L$ called ``atoms'' such that any other element of $L$ can be expressed as a join of atoms. Then, for $L$ an atomic lattice, any poset automorphism $f:L \rightarrow L$ restricts to an automorphism of the atoms of $L$, and $f$ is uniquely determined by this restriction to atoms. In the case of $B_n,$ the atoms are precisely the singletons, and hence can be identified with $[n]$.  Whenever an action $\psi$ of $G$ on $[n]$ is given, we refer to the action $\phi$ defined above as the {\it induced action} on $B_n.$
\end{rem}



\begin{cor}
\label{cor:duality_bn_quotients}
For any action $\phi:G \times B_n \rightarrow B_n,$ both $\mathcal E(B_n/G)$ and $\mathcal E(B_n)/G$ are self-dual. In particular, they are both rank-symmetric. 
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
By Remark \ref{rem:induced_action_bn}, any action $\phi:G\times B_n \rightarrow B_n$ is induced by an action $\psi:G \times [n] \rightarrow [n].$ Using this, observe that for any $\phi,$ the poset $B_n/G$ is self-dual, as there is an isomorphism $f:B_n/G \rightarrow (B_n/G)^{op},G \cdot x \mapsto G \cdot ([n] \setminus x).$ This map is well defined on $G$ orbits because every action on $B_n$ is induced by an action on $[n].$ Then, by Proposition \ref{prop:self_dual_preservation}, it follows that $\mathcal E(B_n/G)$ is self-dual.

It only remains to prove that $\mathcal E(B_n)/G$ is self-dual. However, from Proposition \ref{prop:self_dual_preservation}, $\mathcal E(B_n)$ is self-dual, with the isomorphism given by $\mathcal E(f):\mathcal E(B_n) \rightarrow \mathcal E(B_n^{op})\cong \mathcal E(B_n)^{op},$ that is, the map sending a $(x,y) \mapsto ([n]\setminus y,[n] \setminus x).$ Once again, since the action on $B_n$ is induced by an action on $[n],$ this isomorphism descends to an isomorphism $\mathcal E(f)^G:\mathcal E(B_n)/G \rightarrow \mathcal (E(B_n)/G)^{op},$ and so $\mathcal E(B_n)/G$ is self-dual.
\end{proof}

\ssec{Equivalent Definitions of CCT Actions}

We next give four equivalent definitions of CCT actions. The equivalence of $(1)$ and $(2)$ in the following Lemma \ref{lem:cover_transitive_equivalence} uses the notion of dual posets, while the equivalence of $(1),(3),$ and $(4)$ use the fact that $q:\mathcal E(P)/G) \rightarrow (\mathcal E(P/G)),G(x,y)\mapsto (Gx,Gy)$ is always a surjection.

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:cover_transitive_equivalence}
Let $G$ be a group acting on a graded poset $P.$ The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The action of $G$ on $P$ is CCT.
  \item Whenever $x \lessdot y,x \lessdot z,$ and $y \in Gz,$ there exists some $g \in Stab(x)$ with $gx = z.$
  \item The map $q\colon \mathcal E(P)/G\rightarrow \mathcal E(P/G)$ defined by $q(G(x, y)) = (Gx,Gy)$ is a bijective morphism (but not necessarily an isomorphism).
% \item The map $q\colon \mathcal E(P)/G\rightarrow \mathcal E(P/G)$ defined by $q(G(x, y)) = (Gx,Gy)$ is an injective morphism.
  \item For all $i$ there is an equality $|(\mathcal E(P)/G)_i|=| (\mathcal E(P/G))_i|.$
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
First, we show $(1) \iff (2).$ There is an isomorphism $f:B_n \rightarrow B_n^{op},x \mapsto [n]\setminus x.$ This defines a bijection between triples $(x,y,z)$ with $x \lessdot z,y \lessdot z$ with $x \in Gy,$ and triples $(a,b,c)$ with $c \lessdot a, c \lessdot b$ with $a \in Gb,$ given by $(x,y,z)\mapsto (f(x),f(y),f(z)).$ Furthermore, some $g \in G$ satisfies $g \in Stab(z)$ and $gx = y,$ if and only if it also satisfies $g \in Stab(f(z))$ and $g\cdot f(x) = f(y).$ If an action is CCT, all triples $(x,y,z)$ satisfy these properties, and condition $(2)$ says all triples $(a,b,c)$ satisfy these properties. So, the above shows that $(1)$ is equivalent to $(2).$

Second, we show $(1) \iff (3)$. Observe that $q$ is a bijection exactly when there do not exist distinct orbits $G(x, y) \ne G(x^\prime, y^\prime)$ with $x^\prime\in Gx$, $y^\prime\in Gy$.  Fix $(x, y), (x^\prime, y^\prime)\in \mathcal E(P)$ such that $x^\prime\in Gx$ and $y^\prime\in Gy$.  Pick a $g\in G$ such that $g\cdot y^\prime = y$.  Then $(g\cdot x^\prime, y)\in G(x^\prime, y^\prime)$, so $G(x, y) = G(x^\prime, y^\prime)$ if and only if there exists some $g^\prime\in G$ such that $g^\prime\cdot x = g\cdot x^\prime$ and $g^\prime\cdot y = y$. Hence $q$ is a bijection if and only if the $G$ action is CCT.

%Next, we check $(3) \iff (4)$by Proposition ~\ref{prop:surjection_between_F_quotients}, the morphism $q$ is always surjective. Since an injective map is a bijection if and only if it is a surjection, it follows that $(3) \iff (4).$

Finally, we check $(3)\iff (4).$ Again using Proposition ~\ref{prop:surjection_between_F_quotients}, the morphism $q$ is always surjective. Since a morphism is always rank preserving, it must map $(\mathcal E(P)/G)_i$ surjectively onto $(\mathcal E(P/G))_i.$ However, since the posets are finite, this surjection is a bijection if and only if the sets have the same cardinality.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
While $q$ is a bijection if and only if the action of $G$ on $P$ is CCT, it is {\it not} true that if the action of $G$ on $P$ is CCT, then $q$ is an isomorphism.  For example, take $G=D_{20} \subset S_{10}$ acting by reflections and rotations on $\{1,2,\ldots,10\}$ and hence acting on $B_{10}.$ From Proposition ~\ref{prop:cover_transitive_building_blocks}, this action is CCT. However, consider $x = \{2,4\},y = \{1,2,4\},a = \{2,4,7\},b = \{2,4,6,7\}.$ Then we may observe $(x , y),(a, b) \in \mathcal E(B_{10})$ and $Gx < Ga, Gy < Gb,$ so $(Gx, Gy) <_{\mathcal E} (Ga, Gb).$ However, it is not true that $G(x, y)<_{\mathcal E} G(a,b)$.
\end{rem}

\ssec{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck}}\label{ssec:proof_of_cover_transitive_implies_Peck}

In this section we prove Theorem \ref{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck}, which we recall here:

\cctpeck*

The proof is largely based on the following Lemma.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:bijection_peck_implication}
Let $P,Q$ two graded posets with a morphism $f:P\rightarrow Q$ that is a bijection (but not necessarily an isomorphism). If $P$ is Peck, then $Q$ is Peck.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\rk(P) = \rk(Q) = n$.  Since $P$ is Peck there exists an order-raising operator $U$ such that $U^{n-2i}\colon V(P_i)\rightarrow V(P_{n-i})$ is an isomorphism.  Since $f$ is a poset morphism, it follows that the map $f\circ U\circ f^{-1}$ is an order-raising operator on $Q$.  We then have that $f\circ U^{n-2i}\circ f^{-1} = \left(f\circ U\circ f^{-1}\right)^{n-2i}\colon V(Q_i)\rightarrow V(Q_{n-i})$ is an isomorphism since $U^{n-2i}\colon V(P_i)\rightarrow V(P_{n-i})$ is an isomorphism and $f$ is a bijection.

%Let $\rk(P) = \rk(Q) = n.$ Since $P$ is Peck, there exists an order raising map $U_i:P_i\rightarrow P_{i+1}$ such that $U_{n-i-1} \cdots U_i:P_i \rightarrow P_{n-i}$ is an isomorphism. Then, define $f(U)_i:P_i\rightarrow P_{i+1}$ by $f(U)_i(x) = f(U_i(f^{-1}(x))).$ This map is well defined because $f$ is a bijection. This map is order raising because $y > x \implies f(y) > f(x),$ by definition of morphisms of posets. It follows that since $U_{n-i-1} \cdots U_i$ is an isomorphism, $f(U)_{n-i-1} \cdots f(U)_i$ is as well, because the vector spaces $V(P_i) \cong V(Q_i)$ since $f$ is a bijection. Therefore, $Q$ is Peck.
\end{proof}

By Lemma \ref{lem:bijection_peck_implication} and Proposition \ref{prop:surjection_between_F_quotients}, in order to prove Theorem \ref{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck} it suffices to prove that $\mathcal E(B_n)/G$ is Peck.  One way to do this is to prove that $\mathcal E(B_n)$ is unitary Peck and then apply Theorem \ref{thm:quotients_of_unitary_peck_posets}.  In fact, this approach generalizes to an arbitrary poset $P$.

\begin{thm}
If the action of $G$ on $P$ is CCT and $\mathcal E(P)$ is unitary Peck, then $\mathcal E(P/G)$ is Peck.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Since the $G$-action is CCT, there is a bijection $q\colon\mathcal{E}(P)/G \rightarrow \mathcal{E}(P/G)$ by Lemma ~\ref{lem:cover_transitive_equivalence}.  Since $\mathcal{E}(P)$ is unitary Peck we have that $\mathcal{E}(P)/G$ is Peck by Theorem ~\ref{thm:quotients_of_unitary_peck_posets}, hence $\mathcal{E}(P/G)$ is Peck by Lemma ~\ref{lem:bijection_peck_implication}.
\end{proof}






We prove that $\mathcal E(B_n)$ is unitary Peck in Section \ref{sec:unitary_peck_f}, but unfortunately the proof is messy and computational.  Fortunately there is a cleaner -- albeit less direct -- route.  In order to avoid showing that $\mathcal E(B_n)$ is unitary Peck, we define a graded poset $\mathcal{H}(B_n)$ for all $n$ such that $\mathcal{H}(B_n)$ is easily seen to be unitary Peck in Corollary \ref{cor:HBn_unitary_peck}. Furthermore, we define $\mathcal{H}(B_n)$ such that a group action of $G$ on $B_n$ induces a group action on $\mathcal{H}(B_n)$ (Lemma \ref{lem:G_action_on_HP}) and there is always a bijective morphism $f\colon \mathcal{H}(B_n)/G\rightarrow \mathcal E(B_n)/G$ (Lemma \ref{lem:bijection_h_f}).  By the above discussion, Theorem \ref{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck} readily follows.

\begin{defn}
\label{defn:h_map}
For $P$ a graded poset, define the graded poset $\mathcal H(P)$ as follows. Let the elements $(x, y) \in \mathcal H(P)$ to be pairs $(x,y) \in P\times P$ such that $x \lessdot y$.  Define $(x, y) \lessdot_{\mathcal H} (x^\prime, y^\prime)$ if $x \lessdot x^\prime,y\lessdot y^\prime$ and $x^\prime \neq y.$ Then, define $\leq_{\mathcal H}$ to be the transitive closure of $\lessdot_{\mathcal H}.$ and define $\rk_{\mathcal H}(x, y) = \rk_P(x).$
\end{defn}


\begin{eg}
\label{eg:3boolean}
We give an example of the poset $\mathcal H(B_3)$ in Figure \ref{fig:3boolean}. Observe that $\mathcal H(B_3)$ can be written as a disjoint union of three copies of $B_2.$ This is a single case of the more general phenomenon proven in Proposition \ref{prop:computing_HBn}.

\begin{rem}\label{rem:order_containment}
Note that by definition $(x,y)\lessdot_{\mathcal{H}} (x^\prime,y^\prime)$ precisely when $(x,y)\lessdot_{\mathcal{E}} (x^\prime,y^\prime)$ and $x^\prime\neq y$, hence $(x, y)\lessdot_{\mathcal{H}} (x^\prime, y^\prime) \Rightarrow (x, y)\lessdot_{\mathcal E} (x^\prime, y^\prime)$.  In other words, $\mathcal{H}(P)$ has the same elements as $\mathcal{E}(P)$ but with a weaker partial order.
\end{rem}


\begin{lem}\label{lem:HP_order}
For $P$ a graded poset, the object $\mathcal{H}(P)$, as defined in Definition ~\ref{defn:h_map} is a graded poset.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
This follows immediately from Remark \ref{rem:order_containment} and the fact that $\mathcal E(P)$ is graded.
\end{proof}
%To show $\mathcal H(P)$ is graded, we must show $x\otimes y <_{\mathcal H} a \otimes b \implies \rk(x\otimes y)<rk(a \otimes b)$ and $x\otimes y \lessdot_{\mathcal H} a \otimes b \implies \rk(x\otimes y)+1 = \rk(a \otimes b).$ 

%First, if $x\otimes y <_{\mathcal H} a \otimes b$ then by definition of $<_{\mathcal H},$ in Definition ~\ref{defn:h_map}, we must have $x < a,$ and hence 
%$$\rk_{\mathcal H(P)}(x\otimes y) = \rk_P(x)<rk_P(a) = \rk_{\mathcal H(P)}(a\otimes b).$$
%Second, if $x\otimes y \lessdot_{\mathcal H} a \otimes b$ then $x \lessdot_P a,$ so $\rk(x)+1 = \rk(a)$ and then $$\rk_{\mathcal H(P)}(x\otimes y)+1 = \rk_P(x) +1=rk_P(a)= \rk_{\mathcal H(P)}(a\otimes b).$$

\begin{rem}
While $\mathcal E:\mathcal P \rightarrow \mathcal P$ is a functor, $\mathcal H$ is not a functor. In particular, it is not possible to define $\mathcal H(f)$ for $f$ a morphism. This is illustrated in \ref{fig:h_morphism}. For example, suppose we took $f:P \rightarrow Q$ defined by $f(1) = 1, f(2) = f(3) = 2,f(4) = 3.$ 
It is easy to see that there is no possible morphism $\mathcal H(f):\mathcal H(P)\rightarrow \mathcal H(Q)$ because there are no morphisms at all $\mathcal H(P) \rightarrow \mathcal H(Q).$

Given an action of a group $G$ on $P$, we define an action of $G$ on $\mathcal{H}(P)$ as we did for $\mathcal{E}(P)$ by again defining $g\cdot (x,y) = (gx,gy)$ for all $(x,y)\in P$.  We will then have a well-defined quotient poset $\mathcal{H}(P)/G$ with the same elements as $\mathcal{E}(P)/G$.


\begin{lem}
\label{lem:G_action_on_HP}
The automorphism defined by $g\cdot (x, y)= (gx, gy)$ for all $g\in G$, $(x, y)\in \mathcal{H}(P)$ yields a well-defined group action of $G$ on $\mathcal{H}(P)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Let $g\in G$.  Since $\le_{\mathcal{H}}$ is the transitive closure of $\lessdot_{\mathcal{H}}$ it suffices to show that for all $(x,y),(x^\prime,y^\prime)\in \mathcal{H}(P)$ we have $(x, y) \lessdot_{\mathcal H} (x^\prime,y^\prime) \iff g(x, y) \lessdot_{\mathcal H} g(x^\prime, y^\prime)$.  Since $g$ is an automorphism of $P$, we have $x\le_P x^\prime \iff gx\le_P gx^\prime$, $y\le_P y^\prime \iff gy\le_P gy^\prime$, and $y\neq x^\prime \iff gy\neq gx^\prime$, so the result follows from the definition of $\le_{\mathcal{H}}$.
\end{proof}
%It is rank preserving because $$\rk_{\mathcal H(P)}(g\cdot(x, y)) = \rk_{\mathcal H(P)}(gx, gy)) = \rk_P(gx)=rk_P(x) = \rk_{\mathcal H(P)}(x, y).$$

%The fact that the $G$-action is rank-preserving on $\mathcal{H}(P)$ follows from the fact that $G$-action is rank-preserving on $\mathcalH(P)$.  In order to show the action is order preserving, it suffices to show that if $(x, y) \lessdot_{\mathcal H} (a, b)$ then $g(x, y) \lessdot_{\mathcal H} g(a, b),$ because $\leq_{\mathcal H}$ is the transitive closure of $\lessdot_{\mathcal H}.$ By definition of $\lessdot_{\mathcal H},$ we have $x \lessdot_P a,y\lessdot_P b,y \not \leq b$.  Since $g$ is an automorphism of $P$ for all $g\in G$, it follows that $gx \lessdot_P ga,gy \lessdot_P gb, gy \not \leq_P gb$, hence $g(x, y) \lessdot_{\mathcal H} g(a , b).$






\begin{lem}
\label{lem:bijection_h_f}
The map $f:\mathcal H(P)/G \rightarrow \mathcal E(P)/G$ defined by $G(x,y) \mapsto G(x,y)$ is a bijective morphism for any group action of $G$ on $P$.
%Took part below out because it's not true and because I'm not sure how helpful the true version is - David
%(but never an isomorphism for $n-r > 1$)
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
The elements of $\mathcal H(P)/G,\mathcal E(P)/G$ are the same by definition, so it suffices to show that $f$ is a morphism. Since $f$ is clearly rank-preserving, it suffices to show $f$ is order-preserving. This is immediate from Remark ~\ref{rem:order_containment}.
\end{proof}

The remaining step in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck} is to show that $\mathcal{H}(B_n)$ is unitary Peck, which we do by generalizing Example \ref{eg:3boolean} and showing that $\mathcal{H}(B_n)$ is isomorphic to the disjoint union of boolean algebras.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:computing_HBn}
$\mathcal{H}(B_n)$ is isomorphic to $n$ disjoint copies of $B_{n-1}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let the $n$ disjoint copies of $B_{n-1}$ be labeled $B_{n-1}^{(i)}$, $1\le i\le n$, with the elements of $B_{n-1}^{(i)}$ labeled $x^{(i)}$, $x\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n-1\}$.  We will show that the map 

\begin{align*}
f\colon \mathcal{H}(B_n) &\longrightarrow \bigcup_{i=1}^n B_{n-1}^{(i)}\\
(x,x\cup{i})&\longmapsto x^{(i)}
\end{align*}

\noindent is an isomorphism.  Suppose we have $(x, y),(x', y') \in \mathcal H(B_n)$ with $(x, y) \lessdot (x', y').$ Let $j\in [n]$ such that $y^\prime = y\cup\{j\}$, and let $i\in [n]$ such that $x^\prime = x\cup \{i\}$. If $i \ne j,$ then $x' \leq y,$ contradicting the assumption that $(x, y) \lessdot_{\mathcal H} (x', y').$ Thus $x^\prime = x\cup\{i\}$ and $y^\prime = y\cup\{i\}$ for some $i\in [n]$.

Conversely we can easily check that if $i\not\in y$, then $(x, y)\lessdot_{\mathcal{H}} (x\cup\{i\}, y\cup\{i\})$.  It follows that for all subsets $w \subset [n]$ such that $|w| = 1$, there is an isomorphism from the subposet of elements $\{(x, y)\colon y\setminus x = w\}$ to $B_{n-1}$ defined by $(x,y)\mapsto (x\setminus w,y\setminus w)$.  Furthermore if $y\setminus x \ne y^\prime \setminus x^\prime$, then $(x, y)$ and $(x^\prime, y^\prime)$ are incomparable, so these subposets indexed by $w$ are pairwise disjoint, and $\mathcal H(B_n)$ is isomorphic to $n$ copies of $B_{n}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{cor:HBn_unitary_peck}
$\mathcal H(B_n)$ is unitary Peck for all $n\ge 0$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
This follows immediately from Proposition \ref{prop:computing_HBn} and the fact that $B_{n-1}$ is unitary Peck.  The latter is shown, for instance in \cite[Theorem 2a]{quotients_stanley} by noting that $B_k = (B_1)^k$ and that $B_1$ is clearly unitary Peck.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{cor:quotients_of_HBn_peck}
$\mathcal H(B_n)/G$ is Peck for any subgroup $G\subset S_n$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
This follows from Corollary \ref{cor:HBn_unitary_peck} and Theorem \ref{thm:quotients_of_unitary_peck_posets}.
\end{proof}

The next corollary will not be particularly relevant in proving Theorem \ref{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck}, but let us note it as an aside.

\begin{cor}
Both $\mathcal{E}(B_n)$ and $\mathcal H(B_n)$ have symmetric chain decompositions (SCD).
\end{cor}


\begin{proof}
$\mathcal{H}(B_n)$ has an SCD by Proposition ~\ref{prop:computing_HBn} and the fact that $B_{n-1}$ has an SCD, as shown in \cite{greene}.  By Lemma ~\ref{lem:bijection_h_f} there is a bijective morphism $f\colon\mathcal{H}(B_n)\rightarrow\mathcal{E}(B_n)$, and since a bijective morphism takes an SCD to an SCD it follows that $\mathcal{E}(B_n)$ has an SCD.
\end{proof}


\begin{cor}
\label{cor:quotiented_edge_peck}
$\mathcal E(B_n)/G$ is Peck for any subgroup $G\subset S_n$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
By Corollary ~\ref{cor:quotients_of_HBn_peck}, $\mathcal H(B_n)/G$ is Peck. By Lemma ~\ref{lem:bijection_h_f}, the map $f:\mathcal H(B_n)/G \rightarrow \mathcal E(B_n)/G,G(x, y) \mapsto G(x, y)$ is a bijection. Then, by Lemma ~\ref{lem:bijection_peck_implication}, it follows that $\mathcal E(B_n)/G$ is Peck.
\end{proof}

We are finally in a place to deduce Theorem \ref{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck}.

We are finally in a place to deduce Theorem \ref{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck}]
By Corollary \ref{cor:quotiented_edge_peck}, $\mathcal{E}(B_n)/G$ is Peck for any group action of $G$ on $B_n.$ Since the $G$-action is CCT, there is a bijective morphism from $\mathcal{E}(B_n)/G$ to $\mathcal{E}(B_n/G)$, hence $\mathcal{E}(B_n/G)$ is Peck by Lemma \ref{lem:bijection_h_f}.

Note that we have also developed several generalizations of $\mathcal E,$ for which many similar results hold. For more information, see [\cite{reu_report}, Subsection 3.3]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  CCT actions  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Common Cover Transitive Actions}
\label{sec:cover_transitive}
In this section, we develop the theory of CCT actions $\phi$ where $G$ is a group, $P$ is a poset, and $\phi:G\times P \rightarrow P$ is an action. Recall Definition ~\ref{defn:cover_transitive}, that $\phi$ is CCT if whenever $x,y,z \in P,x\lessdot z,y\lessdot z,x \in Gy$ then there exists $g \in Stab(z)$ with $gx = y$.  We show that the CCT property is closed under semidirect products, in the appropriate sense. From Proposition ~\ref{prop:cover_transitive_building_blocks}, which will be proven in subsection \ref{ssec:dihedral}, the action of $S_n$ on $B_n$ and the action of certain dihedral groups are CCT. We can then use these as building blocks to construct other CCT groups. In particular, we shall show in this section that automorphism groups of rooted trees are CCT.

\begin{eg}
\label{eg:trivial_edgequot}
Two rather trivial examples of CCT actions are $\phi:S_n\times B_n \rightarrow B_n,\psi:G\times B_n\rightarrow B_n$ where $G$ is arbitrary, $\phi$ is the action induced by $S_n$ permuting the elements of $[n]$, and $\psi$ is the trivial action. In the former case, $\mathcal E(B_n/S_n)$ is simply a chain with $n$ points, and so is $\mathcal E(B_n)/S_n,$ since all $(x, y)$ are identified under the $S_n$ action. In the latter case, since $G$ acts trivially by $\phi,$ both  $\mathcal E(B_n/G) \cong \mathcal E(B_n)$ and $\mathcal E(B_n)/G \cong \mathcal E(B_n).$ So again, $\psi$ is CCT.
\end{eg}

\ssec{Preservation Under Semidirect Products}
\label{ssec:semidirect_product_preservation}

\begin{lem}
Let $G\subseteq\operatorname{Aut}(P)$, $H\triangleleft G$, $K\subset G$ such that $G = H\rtimes K$. We then have a well defined group action $K \times P/H \rightarrow P/H,(k,Hx) \mapsto H(k \cdot x).$

\end{lem}
\begin{proof}

Note that if $x,x^\prime\in Hx$ we have $x^\prime = h\cdot x$ for some $h\in H$, and since $H$ is normal in $G$ we have that for all $k \in G$ there exists $h^\prime \in H$ so that $khk^{-1} = h^\prime$, so 

$$k\cdot x^\prime = kh\cdot x = k(k^{-1}h^\prime k)\cdot x = h^\prime\cdot (k\cdot x)$$

Hence $k\cdot x$ and $k\cdot x^\prime$ are in the same $H$-orbit, so we have a well-defined group action of $K$ on $P/H$ defined by $k\cdot Hx = H(k\cdot x)$.
\end{proof}

Recall Proposition ~\ref{prop:semidirect_product_preservation}, as stated in the introduction, which says that the CCT property is preserved under semidirect products.  We will use Proposition ~\ref{prop:semidirect_product_preservation} to construct more examples of CCT group actions, in particular using it to give a simple proofs that CCT actions are preserved under direct products and wreath products.

\semidirect*



\begin{proof}
Since $G = H\rtimes K$, every element $g\in G$ can be written uniquely as a product $hk$ for some $h\in H$, $k\in K$.  Let $x,y,z\in P$ such that $x\lessdot z$, $y\lessdot z$ and such that there exists some $h_0k_0\in G$ such that $h_0k_0\cdot x = y$.  It suffices to show that there exists some $g\in \Stab(z)$ such that $g\cdot x = y$.

The orbits $Hx, Hy, Hz\in P/H$ satisfy $Hx\lessdot Hz$, $Hy\lessdot Hz$ such that $k_0\cdot Hx = Hy$, so since the action of $K$ on $P/H$ is CCT there exists some $k_1\in K$ such that $k_1\in \Stab(Hz)$ and $k_1\cdot Hx = Hy$.  It follows that there exists some $h_1\in H$ such that $h_1k_1h_0\in \Stab(z)$ and $h_1k_1h_0\cdot x\in Hy$.

Write $x^\prime = h_1k_1h_0\cdot x$.  Since the group action of $G$ must be order-preserving by definition, we have that $x^\prime \lessdot z$.  We already had that $y\lessdot z$ and $x^\prime\in Hy$, hence there exists some $h_2\in \Stab(z)$ such that $h_2\cdot x^\prime = y$ by the fact that the action of $H$ on $P$ is CCT.  Then we have that $h_2h_1k_1h_0\cdot x = h_2\cdot x^\prime = y$ and $h_2h_1k_1h_0\cdot z = h_2\cdot z = z$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:direct_product_preservation}
For $\phi:G\times P\rightarrow P,\psi:H \times Q \rightarrow Q$ two CCT actions, then the direct product 
$$\phi \times \psi:(G\times H)\times (P\times Q) \rightarrow (P\times Q),(g,h)\cdot (x,y) \mapsto (gx,hy)$$
is also CCT.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}

%The proof here seemed problematic, but it really is obvious, so I took it out.
%First, by definition of CCT, if either $G$ or $H$ acts trivially, it is clear the action of $G\times H$ is CCT. To see this, suppose $G$ acts trivially, the case of $H$ acting trivially is similar. Then, if $(x,y) \lessdot (a,b),(r,s)\lessdot (a,b),(x,y) \in (G\times H)(r,s),$ then $x \in Gr$ so $x = r.$ There are now two cases, either $b = y = s$ or $x = r = a.$ First, if $b = y = s,$ then $(e,e) \in Stab(x,y)$ and $(e,e)(x,y) = (r,s).$ Second, if $x = r = a,$ and then $y \lessdot b,s \lessdot b,y \in Hs,$ and so by cover transitivity of $G,$ there exists $g \in G$ so that $(e,g)(x,y) = (r,s)$ and $(e,g) \in Stab(a,b).$

First note that if either $G$ or $H$ acts trivially, then it can be easily checked that the action of $G\times H$ is CCT.  Next, observe that $G \times H$ can be viewed as the semidirect product of $(G\times \{e\}) \rtimes (\{e\} \times H).$ Since the action of $G$ on $P$ is CCT, the action of $G\times \{e\}$ on $P \times Q$ is CCT. Also, since the action of $H$ on $Q$ is CCT, it follows that the action of $\{e\}\times H$ on $(P/G) \times Q$ is CCT. Therefore, the action of $(G\times \{e\}) \rtimes (\{e\} \times H)$ satisfies the conditions of Proposition ~\ref{prop:semidirect_product_preservation} and so the action of $G\times H$ is CCT.
\end{proof}

Next, we use Proposition ~\ref{prop:semidirect_product_preservation} to prove in Proposition ~\ref{prop:wreath_preservation} that the CCT property is preserved under wreath products with the symmetric group. First, we need some definitions of wreath product.

\begin{defn}
For $G, H$ groups, with $H \subset S_l,$ the {\it wreath product}, notated $G \wr H,$ is the group whose elements are pairs $(g,h) \in G^l\times H$ with multiplication defined by
\begin{align*}
((g_1',\ldots, g_l'),h') \cdot ((g_1,\ldots, g_l) ,h) =((g'_{h'(1)}g_1,\ldots, g'_{h'(l)}g_l),hh')
\end{align*}
where $H$ acts on $[l]$ via the embedding of $H$ into $S_l$.
\end{defn}

In other words, $G\wr H$ can be viewed as a certain semidirect product of $G^l \rtimes H.$

\begin{defn}
\label{defn:wreath_action}
For any group $G$ with a given action $\psi:G\times P \rightarrow P,$ we obtain an induced action of $G \wr H,$ $\phi:G \wr H \times P^l \rightarrow P^l$ defined by 
$$((g_1,\ldots, g_l),h)(a_1,\ldots, a_l) = (g_{h^{-1}(1)}\cdot a_{h^{-1}(1)},\ldots,g_{h^{-1}(l)} \cdot a_{h^{-1}(l)}).$$
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
Heuristically, one may think of the above action as obtained by first having $G$ act separately on the $l$ distinct copies of $P,$ and then letting $H$ act by permuting the copies.
\end{rem}

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:symmetric_group_product_action}
For $P$ a graded poset, the action 
$$\phi:S_l \times P^l \rightarrow P^l,\sigma \cdot(x_1,\ldots, x_l) = (x_{\sigma(1)},\ldots, x_{\sigma(l)})$$
is CCT.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
For $a \in P^l$ notate $a = (a_1,\ldots, a_l).$ Suppose $x,y,z \in P^l$ with $x\lessdot z,y\lessdot z,$ and $x \in S_ly.$ This means there is a unique $i$ such that $x_i \lessdot z_i,x_k = z_k$ for $k \neq i.$ Additionally, there is a unique $j$ for which $y_j \lessdot z_j,y_k =z_k$ for $k \neq j.$ Since $x \in S_ly,$ so we obtain the equality of multisets $\{x_1,\ldots, x_l\}=\{y_1,\ldots,y_l\}.$ But for $k \neq i,j,x_k = z_k = y_k$, we also obtain equality of sets $\{x_i,x_j\} = \{y_i,y_j\}.$ Since $\rk(y_j) \lessdot \rk(x_j),$ we obtain $y_j = x_i,y_i = x_j.$ Then, taking the transposition $\sigma  = (ij) \in S_l,$ it follows that $\sigma \in Stab(z)$ and $\sigma \cdot x = y.$
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:wreath_preservation}
If $\psi:G\times P \rightarrow P$ is CCT, let $\phi:G\wr S_l \times P^l \rightarrow P^l$ where $\phi$ be the induced action defined in Definition \ref{defn:wreath_action}. Then $\phi$ is also CCT.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Note that the wreath product $G \wr S_l$ can be viewed as a semidirect product $G^l \rtimes S_l$. Since the action of $G$ on $P$ is CCT we obtain that the action of $G^l$ on $P^l$ is CCT by Proposition ~\ref{prop:direct_product_preservation}.  Furthermore the action $S_l \times (P/G)^l \rightarrow (P/G)^l$ defined by $(\sigma ,(x_1,\ldots, x_l)) \mapsto (x_{\sigma(1)}\ldots, x_{\sigma(l)})$ for $\sigma \in S_l$ and $x_i \in P/G$ is CCT by Lemma ~\ref{lem:symmetric_group_product_action}.  Since $P^l/G^l \cong (P/G)^l$, it follows that the action $\phi$ satisfies the conditions of Proposition ~\ref{prop:semidirect_product_preservation}, so $\phi$ is CCT.
\end{proof}
%Explicitly, this action is $(g_1,\ldots, g_l)(x_1,\ldots, x_l) = (g_1 \cdot x_1,\ldots, g_l \cdot x_l).$ 

\ssec{Examples of CCT Actions}\label{ssec:CCT_examples}

In this subsection, we describe several classes of CCT actions. First, we show that the automorphism group of any rooted tree is CCT. Second, we show linear automorphisms of simplices and octahedra are CCT. Third, we show that the left multiplication action is CCT if and only if the group is $\mathbb Z_2^k,$ and that any action of $\mathbb Z_2^k$ on $[n]$ induces a CCT action on $B_n.$

\sssec{An application to rooted trees}
\label{ssec:rooted_trees}
In this subsubsection, we prove that the automorphism group of rooted trees is always CCT. To do this we will apply Proposition ~\ref{prop:wreath_preservation} and Proposition ~\ref{prop:direct_product_preservation}, since the automorphism group of rooted trees is essentially built from direct products and wreath products with a symmetric group. To this aim, we first give definitions relating to rooted trees, then characterize their automorphisms, and finally show that such automorphism groups are always CCT. Our examination of of rooted trees automorphisms here, together with the examination of polytopes in subsubsection \ref{sssec:polytopes} was motivated by \cite[Section 5]{permutation_polytopes}.

\begin{defn}
A graded poset $P$ is a {\it rooted tree} if there is a unique element $x \in P$ of maximal rank, called the {\it root}, and for all $x \in P,$ other than the root, there exists a unique $y \in P$ with $y \gtrdot x.$
\end{defn}

\begin{eg}
In Figure \ref{fig:tree1} and Figure \ref{fig:tree2}, we give two examples of rooted trees.

\begin{defn}
For $P$ a rooted tree, an element $x \in P$ is a {\it leaf} if there is no $z \in P$ with $x > z.$ Denote the set of all leaves of $P$ by $L(P).$
\end{defn}

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:induced_tree_action}
Let $P$ be a rooted tree. Then, the action of $Aut(P)$ on $P$ induces an action of $Aut(P)$ on $L(P).$ Furthermore, there is also an induced action of $Aut(P)$ on $B_n$ where $n = |L(P)|.$ 
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
First, we must show that $Aut(P)$ induces an action on $L(P).$ That is, we must show that for any $g \in Aut(P),x \in L(P),$ then $gx \in L(P).$ If $x \in L(P)$ but $gx \notin L(P),$ then there exists $y < gx.$ However, then $g^{-1}y < x,$ contradicting the assumption that $x$ is a leaf. We then obtain the induced action $Aut(P)\times L(P) \rightarrow L(P),(g,x)\mapsto gx.$

Finally, to obtain the induced action of $Aut(P)$ on $B_n$ identify $L(P) \cong [n]$ as sets, where $|L(P)| = n$. From this we get of action of $Aut(P)$ on $B_n.$
\end{proof}

\begin{note}
For the rest of this section only, fix a rooted tree $P$ and denote by $G$ the group of automorphisms $Aut(P).$ Let $G$ act on $B_n,$ where $n = |L(P)|$, by the induced action $\phi:G \times L(P) \rightarrow L(P)$ described in the proof of Lemma ~\ref{lem:induced_tree_action}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
For $x \in P,$ denote $D(x) = \{y \in P: y \leq x\}.$
\end{note}
\begin{prop}
\label{prop:automorphism_trees}
Let $P$ be a rooted tree with root vertex labeled $0$. Let $\{A_1,\ldots,A_m\}$ denote the set of isomorphism classes of $\{D(x):x\lessdot r\}.$ For $T \in A_j,$ denote $G_j = Aut(T).$ Then, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:level_expansion}
Aut(P) = (G_1 \wr S_{i_1}) \times (G_2 \wr S_{i_2}) \times \cdots \times (G_m\wr S_{i_m}),
\end{equation}
In particular, $Aut(P)$ can be expressed as a sequence of direct products and wreath products of symmetric groups.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
We proceed by induction on the rank of $P$.  It is clear that if $P$ is rank 0, then $Aut(P)$ is trivial.  If the rank of $P$ is greater than 0, label the vertices of $P$ by $\{0,1,\ldots, s\}$ such that the root is labeled $0$ and the vertices just below the root are labeled $1, \ldots, k.$ Let $A_1,\ldots, A_m$ denote the distinct isomorphism classes of trees in the set $\{D(1),\ldots, D(k)\}.$ For $T \in A_j,$ denote $G_j = Aut(T).$ 
Let $T_j = \{t:t\lessdot 0,D(t) \cong A_j\}.$ Then, letting $Q_j$ be the subtree of $P$ whose elements lie in the set $\{0\} \cup (\cup_{t \in T_j} D(t)),$ it follows $Aut(Q_j) \cong G_j \wr S_{i_j},$ because after choosing a permutation of the elements of $T_j,$ we are free to choose any element of $G_j$ to permute each $D(t),t \in T_j$. If $t_1 \lessdot 0,t_2 \lessdot 0,g \cdot t_1 = t_2,$ then it must be that $g \cdot D(t_1) = D(t_2).$ Therefore, $Aut(P)$ must permute these isomorphism classes of trees, and the full automorphism groups is simply the direct product, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:level_expansion}
Aut(P) = (G_1 \wr S_{i_1}) \times (G_2 \wr S_{i_2}) \times \cdots \times (G_m\wr S_{i_m}),
\end{equation}
Since each $G_j$ is a sequence of direct products and wreath products with symmetric groups by the inductive assumption, it follows from ~\eqref{eq:level_expansion} that so is $Aut(P).$
\end{proof}

\begin{eg}
Let $P_1$ be the rooted tree  in Figure \ref{fig:tree1} and $P_2$ be the rooted in Figure \ref{fig:tree2}, the proposition says that $Aut (P_1) = (S_2 \wr S_2)\wr S_2;$ and $Aut(P_2) = (S_2 \wr S_2) \times (S_3 \wr S_2) $. 
\end{eg}

\begin{cor}
\label{cor:tree_cct}
For $P$ the automorphism group of a rooted tree, $Aut(P)$ is CCT.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
By Proposition ~\ref{prop:wreath_preservation}, wreath products with symmetric groups preserve the CCT property, and by Proposition ~\ref{prop:direct_product_preservation} the direct product of two CCT groups is again CCT. Therefore, by Proposition ~\ref{prop:automorphism_trees}, all groups of the form $Aut(P)$ are built up from these operations, and so $Aut(P)$ is also CCT.
\end{proof}

\sssec{Automorphisms of Polytopes}
\label{sssec:polytopes}

As another class of CCT actions, we describe several linear automorphism groups of polytopes whose actions are CCT. In particular, we prove that the linear automorphism groups of simplices and octahedra are CCT.
Later in Proposition ~\ref{prop:cover_transitive_building_blocks}, we will also see that the action of the dihedral group on a regular $n$-gon is CCT for $n = p,2p$.  Since the dihedral group contains all linear automorphisms of the regular $n$-gon, this action gives another example of the linear automorphism group of a polytope being CCT.

\begin{defn}
Let $M$ be a polytope, with a particular embedding in $\mathbb R^n.$ The {\it group of linear automorphisms of M} is the subgroup of $GL_n$ whose elements are $\{g \in GL_n:g \cdot M = M\}.$
\end{defn}

First, we look at linear automorphisms of simplices. Let $G$ be the group linear automorphisms of the $(n-1)$-simplex, whose vertices lie at the standard basis vectors in $\mathbb R^n.$ The action of $G$ on the $(n-1)$-simplex induces an action on $[n],$ given by identifying $[n]$ with the $n$ vertices of the $(n-1)$-simplex. Hence, it induces an action on $B_n.$

\begin{prop}
The action of the group of linear automorphisms of the $(n-1)$-simplex, acting on $B_n,$ as defined above, is CCT.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The group of linear automorphisms in this case induces the usual action of $S_n$ on $B_n,$ because any permutation matrix defines a linear map on $\mathbb R^n.$ However, we know the action of $S_n$ on $B_n$ is CCT from Example ~\ref{eg:trivial_edgequot}
\end{proof}

Next, we look at linear automorphisms of octahedrons. Let $G$ be the group of linear automorphisms of the n-octahedron, embedded inside $\mathbb R^n,$ whose vertices are located at $\pm e_i,$ where $e_1,\ldots e_n$ are the standard basis vectors of $\mathbb R^n.$ Then, the action of $G$ on the octahedron induces an action of $G$ on the $2n$ vertices of the octahedron, and hence on $B_{2n}.$

\begin{prop}
The induced action of the group of linear automorphisms of the $n$ octahedron on $B_{2n}$ is CCT.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
It is simple to see that the group of linear automorphisms of the n-octahedron with vertices at $\pm e_i,$ where $e_1,\ldots e_n$ is the hyperoctahedral group, since it is generated by the permutation matrices, together with the matrix $A$ with $A_{1,1} = -1,A_{i,i} = 1,A_{j,k} = 0$ where $i \neq 1, j \neq k.$ \footnote{The hyperoctahedral group is commonly notated $B_n,$ since it is the type $B$ Coexeter group. We do not use this notation here to avoid confusing it with the boolean algebra.} It is well know that they hyperoctahedral group can be written as $S_2 \wr S_n.$ Then, by Proposition ~\ref{prop:wreath_preservation}, it follows that $S_2 \wr S_n$ is CCT.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
Let us give a brief recap of which linear automorphisms of polytopes are known to induce actions on $B_n$ which are CCT. First, by the above lemmas, for octahedrons and simplices, the induced action is CCT. By Proposition  \ref{prop:cover_transitive_building_blocks} and Proposition \ref{prop:iff_dihedral_cct} the linear automorphism group of an $n$-gon induces a CCT action on $B_n$ if and only if one of $n=1,n = p,n = 2p,$ for $p$ a prime. Additionally, computers have verified that automorphisms of the 3-cube, with vertices at $(\pm 1,\pm 1,\pm 1)$ induces a CCT action. It is still unknown whether the linear automorphisms of $n$-cubes is CCT for $n> 3,$ and also whether the remaining five exceptional regular polytopes (namely the dodecahedron and icosahedron in $\mathbb R^3$ as well as the $24$-cell, $120$-cell, and $600$-cell polytopes in $\mathbb R^4$) induce CCT actions. These questions are repeated in Question \ref{question:cube_cct} and Question \ref{question:exceptional_polytopes_cct}.

\end{rem}

\sssec{CCT Actions of $\mathbb Z_2^k$}

In this subsubsection, we show that any embedding of $\mathbb Z_2^k$ into $S_n$ defines an action on $B_n$ which is CCT. In particular, this implies that the left multiplication action of $\mathbb Z_2^k$ is CCT. However, it turns out that this is the only class of groups for which the left multiplication action is CCT.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:regular_action_CCT}
Recall that $G$ is an elementary abelian $2$-group if $G \cong (\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z)^k$ for some $k \in \mathbb N.$
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For any $n \in \mathbb N,$ and $G$ an elementary abelian 2-group, every $G$ action on $B_n$ is CCT.
  \item For every finite group $G$ which is not an elementary abelian 2-group, there exists at least one $G$ action which is not CCT, namely the action of $G$ on $B_n$ induced by the left-regular action of $G$ on itself, where $n = |G|$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
\vskip.1in
\noindent
{\sf Part (1)}
Let $x,y,z\in B_n$ such that $x \lessdot z, y \lessdot z$, and  $x = gy$ for some $g\in G$.  Since $x\ne y$ we have $z=x\cup y$.  Furthermore, since every element in $\mathbb Z_2^k$ has order 2 we have that $gy = g^2x = x$ and thus $gz = gx\cup gy = y\cup x = z$. Hence $g\in\Stab(z)$ and thus $\phi$ is CCT.

\vskip.1in
\noindent
{\sf Part (2)}
First, let us show $G \cong \mathbb Z_2^k \iff \forall g \in G,g^2 = e.$ The forward implication is obvious. To see the converse, first note that if $\forall g \in G, g^2 = e,$ then $G$ is abelian because $aba^{-1}b^{-1} = abab = (ab)^2 = e.$ Then, $G$ is an abelian group, all of whose elements have order two. The structure theorem of finite abelian groups tells us $G \cong \mathbb Z_2^k.$

So, Suppose $G \not \cong \mathbb Z_2^k.$ Then, there exists $g \in G,g^2 \neq e.$ Clearly $\{e\}\lessdot \{e \cup g\},\{g\} \lessdot \{e \cup g\},\{g\} \in G\{e\}.$ So, to show the induced action $\phi: G \times B_n \rightarrow B_n$ is not CCT, it suffices to show there is no $h \in G,h \in Stab(\{e \cup g\}),h\cdot \{e\} =\{g\}.$  If $h \in \Stab(\{e \cup g\})$ then $h \cdot e = e$ or $h \cdot e = g.$ In both cases, it is simple to see that $g^2 = e.$ Therefore, there does not exist such an $h$ and left multiplication is not CCT.
\end{proof}


\iffalse

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:order_2_CCT}
Let $n,k$ be arbitrary. Let $G = \mathbb Z_2^k$ and pick any group action $\phi:G\times [n] \rightarrow [n].$ Then the induced action $\phi:G \times B_n \rightarrow B_n$ is CCT.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Let $x,y,z\in B_n$ such that $x \lessdot z, y \lessdot z$, and  $x = gy$ for some $g\in G$.  Since $x\ne y$ we have $z=x\cup y$.  Furthermore, since every element in $\mathbb Z_2^k$ has order 2 we have that $gy = g^2x = x$ and thus $gz = gx\cup gy = y\cup x = z$, hence $g\in\Stab(z)$ and thus $\phi$ is CCT.
\end{proof}
%First, observe that all elements $g \in G$ have order 2. Suppose $x \lessdot z, y \lessdot z, x = gy.$ We will show $g \in Stab(z).$ By definition, this would imply that $\phi$ is common cover transitive. 
%
%Let $a$ be the unique element such that $a \in y, a \notin x.$ Certainly $g(y\setminus a) \subset gx=y \subset z.$ So, to show $g \in Stab(z),$ it suffices to show that $ga \in x.$ Let $b = g^{-1}a.$ We know $b \in x.$ However, since $g$ has order 2, it must be that $ga = g^2 b = b \in x.$ Hence, $g \in Stab(z),$ and $\phi$ is CCT.


%\begin{cor}
%\label{cor:regular_order_2_CCT}
%Let $\mathbb Z_2^k$ act on itself by left multiplication $\psi:\mathbb Z_2^k \times \mathbb Z_2^k \rightarrow \mathbb Z_2^k,(g,h) \mapsto g\cdot h.$ By identifying $\mathbb Z_2^k \cong [2^k]$ as sets, we obtain an induced action $\phi:\mathbb Z_2^k \times B_{2^k} \rightarrow B_{2^k}$ which is cover transitive.
%\end{cor}
%\begin{proof}
%By Lemma ~\ref{lem:order_2_CCT}, any embedding of $\mathbb Z_2^k \rightarrow S_n$ defines a CCT action on $B_n.$ So, this particular embedding defines a CCT action.
%\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:regular_action_CCT}
Let $G$ be a finite group, acting on itself by left multiplication, $\psi:G\times G \rightarrow G,(g,h)\mapsto g\cdot h$, with $|G| = n.$ By identifying $G \cong [n]$ as sets, $\psi$ this induces an action $\phi:G\times B_n \rightarrow B_n.$ Then, $\phi$ is CCT if and only if $G \cong \mathbb Z_2^k$ for some $k.$
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}

By Lemma ~\ref{lem:order_2_CCT}, any embedding of $\mathbb Z_2^k \rightarrow S_n$ defines a CCT action on $B_n$, so $\phi$ is CCT if $G \cong \mathbb Z_2^k$.

%If $G\cong \mathbb Z_2^k,$ then by Corollary ~\ref{cor:regular_order_2_CCT}, we know the action $\phi:G\times B_{2^k} \rightarrow B_{2^k}$ is indeed CCT.

Next, we prove the converse. First, let us show $G \cong \mathbb Z_2^k \iff \forall g \in G,g^2 = e.$ The forward implication is obvious. To see the converse, first note that if $\forall g \in G, g^2 = e,$ then $G$ is abelian because $aba^{-1}b^{-1} = abab = (ab)^2 = e.$ Then, $G$ is an abelian group, all of whose elements have order two, the structure theorem of finite abelian groups tells us $G \cong \mathbb Z_2^k.$

So, Suppose $G \not \cong \mathbb Z_2^k.$ Then, there exists $g \in G,g^2 \neq e.$ Clearly $\{e\}\lessdot \{e \cup g\},\{g\} \lessdot \{e \cup g\},\{g\} \in G\{e\}.$ So, to show the induced action $\phi: G \times B_n \rightarrow B_n$ is not CCT, it suffices to show there is no $h \in G,h \in Stab(\{e \cup g\}),h\cdot \{e\} =\{g\}.$  If $h \in Stab(\{e \cup g\})$ then $h \cdot e = e$ or $h \cdot e = g.$ In both cases, it is simple to see that $g^2 = e.$ Therefore, there does not exist such an $h$ and left multiplication is not CCT.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
One nice way of restating the above results is that for $G$ an abstract group, there exists some $n$ and some embedding $G \subset S_n$ such that the induced action of $G$ on $B_n$ is not CCT if and only if $G \not \cong Z_2^k$ for some $k.$ If $G\cong Z_2^k,$ we have seen this holds in Lemma ~\ref{lem:order_2_CCT}. If $G \not \cong Z_2^k,$ then by Proposition ~\ref{prop:regular_action_CCT}, the left multiplication action of $G$ on $B_{|G|}$ defines an action which is not CCT.
\end{rem}
\begin{prop}
Let $G$ be the group of linear automorphisms of the cube, embedded in $\mathbb R^n,$ whose vertices are located at the points $(\pm 1, \ldots, \pm 1).$ Then, the action of $G$ on the cube induces an action of $G$ on the $2^n$ vertices of the octahedron, and hence on $B_{2^n}.$ This induced action on $B_{2^n}$ is CCT. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
It is easy to see that the group of linear automorphisms of the cube can be written as the semidirect product $\mathbb Z^n_2 \rtimes S_n.$ The generator of the $i^{th}$ copy of $\mathbb Z_2$ in $\mathbb Z^n_2,$ acts by changing the sign of the $i^{th}$ coordinate, while $S_n$ acts by permuting the coordinates. Using Proposition ~\ref{prop:semidirect_product_preservation}, it suffices to show that the action of $\mathbb Z_2^n$ on $B_{2^n}$ is CCT and the action of $S_n$ on $B_{2^n}/(\mathbb Z_2^n)$ is CCT.

First, by Lemma ~\ref{lem:order_2_CCT}, we know the action of $\mathbb Z_2^n$ on $B_{2^n}$ is CCT. Second, we wish to examine the action of $S_n$ on the quotient poset $B_{2^n}/(\mathbb Z_2^n).$ 
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Wreath Product  S_m with S_l %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Wreath Product of two Symmetric Groups}\label{sec:wreath_product}

In this section, we prove a result similar to that of \cite[Theorem 1.1]{pak}. We construct a certain sequence which is not only unimodal, but can even be exhibited as the ranks of a Peck poset. This construction gives an alternate proof of \cite[Theorem 1.1]{pak} in the case that $r = 1.$

\begin{note}
For this section, fix $l,m$ with $n = l \cdot m$ and fix $G = S_m \wr S_l.$ Let $S_m$ act on $B_m$ by the permutation representation, and then let $G$ act on $B_{m}^l\cong B_{m \cdot l}$ by the action defined in Definition \ref{defn:wreath_action}.
\end{note}

\ssec{Pak and Panova's Result}
We first review the necessary definitions and then state \cite[Theorem 1.1]{pak}:

A {\it partition} is a sequence of numbers $\lambda = (\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_k)$ such that $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_k.$ If $\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i = n$ then $\lambda$ is a {\it partition of $n$}, notated $\lambda \vdash n.$ A {\it composition} is a sequence of numbers $\lambda = (\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_k).$ That is, it is a partition where order matters. If $\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i = n$ then $\lambda$ is a {\it composition of $n$}. Let $P_n(l,m)$ denote the set of partitions $\lambda = (\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_k) \vdash n,$ such that $\lambda_1 \leq m,k \leq l.$ That is, $P_n(l,m)$ is the partitions which fit inside an $l \times m$ rectangle.

\begin{note}
\cite[Section 1]{pak} For $\lambda$ a partition, let $\nu(\lambda)$ be the number of distinct nonzero part sizes of $\lambda.$
\end{note}

\begin{note}
\cite[Section 1]{pak}
Let $p_k(l,m,r) = \sum_{\lambda \in P_k(l,m)} \binom{\nu(\lambda)}{r}.$
\end{note}

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:pak_thm}
\cite[Theorem 1.1]{pak}
The sequence $p_r(l,m,r), p_{r+1}(l,m,r),\ldots, p_{l\cdot m}(l,m,r)$ is unimodal and symmetric.
\end{thm}

\ssec{A Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:pak_thm} for $r = 1$}
Now that we have managed to state Pak and Panova's Theorem, we can now conclude that Theorem \ref{thm:pak_thm} holds in the case of $r=1.$ In fact, we can do better, by realizing $p_i(l,m,1)$ as ranks of a Peck poset.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:rank_gen_fn_wreath_1}
There is an equality $|(\mathcal E(B_n)/G)_i| = |\mathcal E(B_n/G)_i| = p_{1+i}(l,m,1).$ In particular, Theorem \ref{thm:pak_thm} holds in the case $r = 1.$
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}

First, observe that $S_m \wr S_l$ can be described as the automorphism group of a rooted tree of rank 2 with $l$ elements at rank $1$ and $m\cdot l$ elements at rank 2, such that each element at rank $1$ is above $m$ elements at rank 2. Then, by Corollary \ref{cor:tree_cct}, it follows that the action of $G$ on $B_{m \cdot l}$ is CCT and so $\mathcal E^r(B_n/G)$ is Peck.

Next, note that each equivalence class in $B_n/G$ has a unique representative which is a Young Tableau. For example, see [\cite{reu_report}, Lemma 5.11] for a complete proof.

Now, let $Gx,Gy$ be two $G$ orbits with $\bar x$ the Young Tableau corresponding to $x,$ and $\bar y$ the young tableau corresponding to $y.$ Suppose $Gx \lessdot Gy.$ Then, $\bar x$ must be contained in $\bar y,$ but with a single box removed. Since $\bar x,\bar y$ are both Young Tableau, the removed box must be one of the corners of $\bar y$. Observe that the number of corners of a partition is precisely the number of distinct part sizes, and so $|\{Gx|Gx \lessdot Gy\}| = \nu(\bar y).$ Therefore,
\begin{align*}
  |\mathcal E(B_n/G)_i| &= \sum_{(Gx,Gy) \in \mathcal E(B_n/G)_i} 1 
  \\
  &= \sum_{Gy \in (B_n/G)_{i+1}} \left(\sum_{Gx \lessdot Gy}^{} 1 \right) 
  \\
  &= \sum_{Gy \in (B_n/G)_{i+1}}\nu(\bar y) 
  \\
  &=  \sum_{\lambda \in P_{i+1}(l,m)} \nu(\lambda).
\end{align*}

Therefore, $|(\mathcal E(B_n)/G)_i| = |\mathcal E(B_n/G)_i| = p_{1+i}(l,m,1).$ Since $\mathcal E(B_n)/G$ is Peck,
\linebreak
$p_1(l,m,1), p_{2}(l,m,1),\ldots, p_{l\cdot m}(l,m,1)$ is unimodal, and hence Theorem \ref{thm:pak_thm} holds in the case $r = 1.$
\end{proof}

\section{Unimodal Quotients}
\label{sec:unimodal}

In this section, we show that several important posets $\mathcal E(B_n/G)$ are rank-unimodal. Note, they are always rank-symmetric by Corollary \ref{cor:duality_bn_quotients}. First, we show unimodality for left multiplication actions. That is, if $|G| = n,$ the action of $G$ on itself by left multiplication induces an action of $G$ on $B_n$ such that $|(\mathcal E(B_n)/G)_i| = \binom {n-1} i.$ Using this result, we show that the action of the cyclic group, $C_n,$ on the vertices of an $n$-gon by rotation induces an action on $B_n$ such that $\mathcal E(B_n/C_n)$ is rank-unimodal and rank-symmetric. Then, letting the dihedral group act on the vertices of an $n$-gon by rotations and reflections, we obtain an induced action on $B_n$ so that $\mathcal E(B_n/D_{2n})$ is rank-unimodal and rank-symmetric. Furthermore, in the case that $n = p,2p$ for $p$ a prime, the action of $D_{2n}$ on $B_n$ is CCT.

Note that the sizes of $\mathcal E(B_n)/G$ can be calculated in general using Redfield Polya theory, which leads to many interesting enumerative formulas, as detailed in [\cite{reu_report}, Section 6]

\ssec{Groups of order $n$}

In this subsection, we show that for any group $G$ with $|G| = n$ and a transitive action $\phi: G \times B_n \rightarrow B_n$, then $$|(\mathcal E(B_n)/G)_i| = \binom {n-1}{i}.$$ 
Note that by identifying $G \cong [n]$ as sets, any such action is isomorphic to the action induced by left multiplication $$\psi: G\times G \rightarrow G,(g,h)\mapsto g \cdot h.$$ 
%We can then use a simple result in group theory to calculate the ranks of $\mathcal E(B_n)/G$ for all transitive actions $\phi:G\times P \rightarrow P,$ where $G$ is abelian.

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:stabilizer_one}
For $G$ a group with $|G| = n,$ and a transitive action $\phi:G \times [n] \rightarrow [n],$ it follows that for all $x \in G,\Stab(x) = \{e\}.$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
This statement follows immediately from the Orbit Stabilizer theorem. Namely, for $x \in [n]$ the Orbit Stabilizer theorem implies $|G| = |Stab(x)||Gx|.$ Then, since $G$ is transitive, $|Gx| = |G|$ and so $|Stab(x)| = 1.$ Since it is always true that $e \in Stab(y),$ it follows for all $x \in G,\Stab(x) = \{e\}.$
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:stabilizer_edge}
Let $G$ be a group with $|G| = n,$ and a transitive action $\phi:G \times [n] \rightarrow [n],$ inducing an action $\phi:G \times \mathcal E(B_n)\rightarrow \mathcal E(B_n).$ For any element $(x , y) \in \mathcal E(B_n),\Stab(x, y) = \{e\}.$
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Note that the action $\phi$ induces an action of $G$ on $B_n,$ which in turn induces an action of $G$ on $\mathcal E(B_n).$ Then, by definition $\Stab(x, y) = \Stab(x) \cap \Stab(y) = \Stab(x) \cap \Stab(y \setminus x).$ However, $y \setminus x$ is by assumption a 1 element set, because $|y| = |x| +1,x \subset y.$ By Lemma \ref{lem:stabilizer_one}, $\Stab(y\setminus x) = \{e\}.$ Hence, $\Stab(x, y)=\Stab(x) \cap \Stab(y \setminus x) = \Stab(x) \cap \{e\} = \{e\}$ for all $(x, y) \in \mathcal E(B_n),$ as claimed.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:q_counts}
Let $G$ be a group with $|G| = n$ and a transitive action $\psi:G \times [n] \rightarrow [n],$ inducing an action $\phi:G \times \mathcal E(B_n)\rightarrow \mathcal E(B_n).$ Then, $\displaystyle |(\mathcal E(B_n)/G)_i| = \binom{n-1}{i}.$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
There are $\binom{n}{i}$ elements $x\in(B_n)_i.$ For each $x \in (B_n)_i$ there are $n-i$ elements $y \in (B_n)_{i+1}$ so that $x \subset y.$ Hence, there are a total of $\binom{n}{i}\cdot (n-i)$ elements $(x, y) \in \mathcal E^r(B_n)_i.$ By Proposition ~\ref{prop:stabilizer_edge}, we have $|\Stab(x, y)| = 1.$ Therefore, by the Orbit Stabilizer Theorem, it follows $|G(x, y)| = n.$ From this,
\begin{align*}
|\mathcal E(B_n)_i/G| = |\mathcal E(B_n)_i|/|G| = \frac{\binom{n}{i}\cdot (n-i)}{n} = \binom {n-1}{i}.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Cyclic  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\ssec{Quotient by the Cyclic Group}
\label{sec:cyclic}

In this subsection, let $G = C_n$ be the cyclic group of order $n$ and let $G$ act on $[n]$ identifying the $[n]$ with the vertices of a regular $n$-gon, and having $C_n$ act by cyclically permuting these vertices. Then, let $G$ act on $B_n$ by the induced action. We show the poset $ \mathcal E(B_n/G)$ is rank-unimodal. From Lemma ~\ref{lem:q_counts}, we know that for $G = C_n$, the size of the $i$th rank of the poset $ \mathcal E (B_n)/C_n$ is $$|( \mathcal E (B_n)/C_n)_i| = \binom{n-1}{i}.$$
We will relate $|( \mathcal E(B_n/C_n))_i|$ to $|( \mathcal E (B_n)/C_n)_i|$ to obtain the unimodality. 

\begin{rem}
Since the action of $G$ on $[n]$ by rotation of the vertices of an $n$-gon can also be viewed as the action of $G$ on itself by left multiplication, by Proposition \ref{prop:regular_action_CCT}, we know this action of $G$ on $B_n$ is not CCT for $n > 2.$
\end{rem}


\begin{note} We fix an arbitrary $n$ to start with,  set $$Q(n) =  \mathcal E (B_n)/C_{n}, \quad P(n) =  \mathcal E(B_n/C_{n})$$ and let $$q (i, n) =|Q(n)_i|, \quad p (i, n) =|P(n)_i|. $$  When there is no ambiguity of which $n$ we are referring to, we denote $Q(n), P(n)$ respectively by $Q, P$, and write $q_i = q(i, n), p_i = p (i, n)$.
\end{note}

The quotient $B_n /C_n$ is the well-studied necklace poset. The elements in the poset are represented by $n$ filled or empty beads ordered cyclically. Label the positions of the beads in the necklace by $1, 2, ..., n$. More specifically, since each element $x \in B_n$ is represented by a sequence of empty or filled beads, an element $G(x) \in B_n/C_n$ is represented by such a sequence up to rotational equivalence.  Similarly, an element $(Gx, Gy) \in \big( \mathcal E(B_n)/C_n\big)_{i}$ where $x \lessdot y$ can be regarded as a necklace where $i+1$ beads out of $n$ are filled (which represent $y$), and $1$ of the filled bead is distinct from all others (so that $y$ together with this one bead represents $x$).
 
\begin{note}
We fix $\sigma_0 = (1 \: 2 \: ... \: n),$ the generator of the group $C_n$.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
For the remainder of this section, we abuse notation by writing $(Gx, Gy)$ in place of $(Gx, Gy) \cap  \mathcal E(B_n)$ as sets, and hence, viewing $(Gx, Gy) = (Gx, Gy) \cap  \mathcal E(B_n)\subset  \mathcal E(B_n).$ Namely, $$(Gx, Gy) = \left\{ (\sigma x, \tau y) \in  \mathcal E (B_n) : \sigma, \tau \in G; \, \, \sigma x \lessdot \tau y  \right\}.$$ Similarly, we view $$G(x, y) = \left\{ (gx , g y) \in  \mathcal E (B_n) : g \in G \right\} $$
\end{note}

\begin{defn}
Let  $\sigma \in G.$ We call each subset $s \subset x \in B_n$ that is fixed by $\sigma$ a \textit{full cycle} (under the action of $\sigma$). Let $\mathcal S$ be the set of all full cycles in $x$. We call $x \setminus \left(\cup_{s \in \mathcal S}  s \right)$ a \textit{tail cycle} (under the action of $\sigma$).  
\end{defn}


\begin{lem}{\label{lem:cyclic_bound_r}}
Suppose that $\sigma_0^r x \lessdot y$ for some $(x,y)$, where $x \lessdot y$ and $r < n/2$. Also suppose that there is no $g \in G$ such that $g x = \sigma_0^r (x)$ and $gy = y$. Then $r$ is the only integer $1 \le r < n/2$ such that $\sigma_0^r (x) \lessdot y$. 
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}

By assumption, $x$ has a tail cycle under the action of $\sigma_0^{r}$, for otherwise $x$ is fixed by $\sigma_0^r,$ because then $g = \id$ satisfies $gx = \sigma_0^rx,gy = y.$ Additionally, $y$ must have some tail cycles under the action of $\sigma_0^r$, for otherwise $y$ is fixed under $\sigma_0^r$  and we can take $g = \sigma_0^r$.  Call $\gamma$ the tail cycle of $y$, so $\gamma$ consists of some filled beads in the necklace, one of which is the element $a = y \backslash x$. Let $\sigma$ be a rotation such that $\sigma x \lessdot y$. Then $\sigma$ has to take a full cycle of $x$ (under $\sigma_0^r$) to another full cycle (under $\sigma_0^r$), and it is clear that $\sigma (\gamma \backslash a) \lessdot \gamma$. Recall that $\sigma_0^r (\gamma \backslash a) \lessdot \gamma$ by assumption, so the elements in $\gamma$ are $r$-positions away from each other (in the necklace representation), in other words, we can write $\gamma = \{ a, a-r, a-2r, ... a -l r\}$, but $a+r \notin \gamma,$ since $\gamma$ is a tail cycle. Assume for contradiction that there is some other $\sigma' \ne \sigma_0^r$ such that $\sigma' (\gamma \backslash a) \lessdot \gamma$, then there exists $m > 1$ for which $\sigma'(a - m r) = a$, namely the rotation sends $a -m r \mapsto a$. But then, since $m > 1$, $a-(m-1)r \in x$ and $a - (m-1) r \ne a$. Hence $(a - (m-1)r) \mapsto a+r \in y$, a contradiction. 

\end{proof}

\begin{lem}{\label{lem:cyclic_counting_difference}} 
Let $G= C_n$, and $q_i = q(i, n), p_i = p(i, n)$ as usual, 
then $$q_i - p_i = |\left\{G{(x, y)} : \exists \: \, \sigma_0^r x \lessdot y \text{ where } r < n/2, \text{ but } \nexists \:  g \text{ s.t. } g x = \sigma_0 ^r x, g y = y \right\}|.$$
\end{lem}


\begin{proof}
By definition, $q_i$ counts  number of the disjoint subsets $G(x, y)$ in $ \mathcal E (B_n)$ and $p_i$ counts the number of disjoint subsets $(Gx, Gy)$. Hence the difference of $q_i - p_i$ is counting the difference of the number of $G$-orbits $G (x ,y)$ and the number of $(Gx,Gy) \in  \mathcal E(B_n/C_n)$.  Note that as subsets of $ \mathcal E (B_n)$, $G(x, y) \subset (Gx, Gy)$, so the problem of counting $q_i - p_i$ is the same as that of counting the number of distinct $G$-orbits $G(x , y)$  with non-identity $\sigma \in G$ such that $\sigma x < y$. 


As mentioned above, it is clear that the $G$-orbits correspond to the (rotational equivalence classes of) fillings of the necklaces, where we fill $i+1$ elements with $1$ of them being marked as the distinct element. Lemma \ref{lem:cyclic_bound_r} tells us that each subset $(Gx, Gy) \subset  \mathcal E (B_n)$, contains at most two $G$-orbits of the form $G(x,y)$ (also regarded as subsets of $ \mathcal E (B_n)$). The number of $(Gx, Gy)$ containing exactly two $G$ orbits is precisely the number of pairs of $G$-orbits $(G (x, y),G(\sigma x, y ))$ (where $ x \lessdot y$ and $\sigma x \lessdot y$) with $G(x, y) \neq G(\sigma x, y).$ The number of such pairs is then the number of $G(x, y)$ such that $ \exists r,r<\frac n 2, G(\sigma_0^r x, y)\neq G(x, y),\sigma_0^r x \lessdot y.$ We restrict $r < n/2$ to avoid double counting pairs. This proves the Lemma.
\end{proof}

For the unimodality of $p_i$, we first consider a special case where $n = p$ is a prime, for which we have a simple formula for $p_i$ based on the formula for $q_i$.

\begin{lem}{\label{lem:cyclicprime}}
Let $G = C_p$ where $p$ is a prime, $p \neq 2$ then $q_i - p_i = (p-1)/2$ for $ 1 \le i \le p-2$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}  By Lemma \ref{lem:cyclic_counting_difference}, we need to prove that the number of $G$-orbits $G(x,y)$ such that there is some $r < n/2$ with $\sigma_0^r x \lessdot y$ but there does not exist $g \in \text{stab}(y)$ such that $gx = \sigma_0^r x$ is $(p-1)/2.$ 

 We consider the action of $G$ on $B_p$. 
 Note that $p$ being a prime guarantees that the action of any nontrivial $\sigma \in G$ has no fixed points, since $\sigma$ is always an $p$-cycle in its cycle decomposition. Now suppose $(x, y) \in  \mathcal E(B_p)_i$  is an element such that $\sigma x =y$ for some $\sigma \neq e$. Then, there is no $g \in C_p$ such that $gx = \sigma x$ and $g y = y$, since $gx = \sigma x \Rightarrow g = \sigma $ and $g y = y \Rightarrow g = e$. Therefore, in the case where $p$ is a prime,  we have: 
 $$q_i - p_i = |\left\{G{(x, y)} : \exists \: \, \sigma_0^r x \lessdot y \text{ where } 1 \le r < n/2 \right\}|.$$

%Let $(Gx, Gy)$  be an element in $( \mathcal E(B_p/G))_i$, in other words, an edge class in the necklace poset with representative $(x, y)$. Note that we view $G(x , y)$ as a subset of $ \mathcal E (B_p)$, namely $G(x, y) = \{(gx, g y) : g \in G \}$. Clearly $G(x , y) \subset (Gx,Gy)$ as subsets of $ \mathcal E (B_p)$. It is clear that the number of distinct $\sigma \in G$ such that $\sigma x \lessdot y$ is precisely the number of $G$-orbits in $(Gx, Gy)$. In particular, if the only $\sigma $ such that $\sigma x \lessdot y$ is identity, then $(Gx, Gy)=G(x, y)$ as subsets of $ \mathcal E (B_p)$. 

We claim that for each $r$ such that $1 \le r < p/2$, there is precisely one $G$ orbit $G(x, y)$ such that $\sigma_0^r x \lessdot y$. 

First consider $r = 1$, so $\sigma = \sigma_0$. Suppose there is $(x,y) \in  \mathcal E(B_n)$ such that $x \lessdot y$ and $\sigma x \lessdot y$, i.e., we take out the distinct filled bead from $y$ in the necklace, and rotate $y$ by $\sigma_0$, then the remaining $i$ filled beads remain in $\sigma y$. It is clear that the only way this can happen is if we have $i+1$ consecutive filled beads, which gives the same $G$-orbit as $G(x, y)$.

The same construction applies to all cases where $1 \le r < p/2$, so for each $r = 1, 2, ..., (p-1)/2$, there is a precisely one orbit $G(x_r,y_r)$ such that $x_r \lessdot y_r$ and $\sigma_0^r  x < y$. This proves the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}{\label{cor:cyclic_prime_unimodal}} Let $G = C_n$ where $n$ is a prime, and $p_i$ as defined above. Then the sequence $p_i$ is unimodal. 
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
By the Lemma \ref{lem:cyclicprime} and Lemma \ref{lem:q_counts}, we can explicitly compute the $p_i$ to obtain that $p_i \leq p_{i+1}$ for $0 < i < n/2.$ By the symmetry of $p_i$, we only need to show $p_0 \le p_1$, but $p_0 = 1$, so the claim holds.
\end{proof}

A similar method can be used to bound $q_i - p_i$ for $n$ not necessarily prime. Let $\lambda_i = q_i - p_i$, our next goal in the section is to show that,  for sufficiently large $n$, the difference $\lambda_{i+1} - \lambda_{i}$ is bounded above by  $q_{i+1} - q_i$. This is shown in Lemma \ref{lem:cyclic_bounding_lambda}. 

Note that this suffices to show that the $p_i$ are unimodal, since this would imply $$p_{i+1} - p_{i} = (q_{i+1} - \lambda_{i+1}) - (q_i - \lambda_i) = (q_{i+1} - q_i) - (\lambda_{i+1}- \lambda_i) \ge 0.$$ 


\begin{defn}
Fix $r < n/2$ to be an integer and let $ G(x, y)$ be a $G$-orbit of edges. We call $G(x , y)$ an {\it isolated pair} if  $ \sigma_0^r x \lessdot y, \, \, \text{ but  there does not exist } g \in C_n \text{ such that } g x = \sigma_0 ^r x,  \text{ and }g y = y$. 
\end{defn}

First we prove several sub-lemmas. 

\begin{defn}
For the next couple proofs, we will use the notation

$$S_1 = \left\{G{(x, y)} : \exists \: \, \sigma_0^r x \lessdot y \text{ where } r < n/2, \text{ but } \nexists \:  g \text{ s.t. } g x = \sigma_0 ^r x, g y = y \right\} $$ and $$S_2= \left\{ G(x, y):  \exists \: \, \sigma_0^r x \lessdot y \text{ where } r < n/2,  \text{ and } y \text{ has a tail cycle}  \right\}.$$
\end{defn}


\begin{lem} \label{lem:bounding_sublemma1}
$\lambda_i = p_i - q_i$ is equal to the number of $G(x, y)\in \mathcal \epsilon(B_n)/G$ such that there exists $r < n/2$ with $\sigma_0^r x \lessdot y$ and $y$ has a tail cycle under the action of $\sigma_0^r$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
From Lemma \ref{lem:cyclic_counting_difference} we know that,  $\lambda_i = q_i - p_i = |S_1|$. We want to show that $S_1 = S_2$. It is clear that $S_2 \subset S_1$, so it remains to show that $S_1 \subset S_2$. 

For each $r < n/2$ such that $(r, n) = 1$, there is precisely one such $G$-orbit for each $i$, since in this case $\sigma_0^r$ is a full $n$-cycle and the argument in Lemma \ref{lem:cyclicprime} applies. In this case, suppose that $\sigma_0^r x \lessdot y$ then $y$ is automatically a tail cycle. 

Now consider $r < n/2$ such that $(r, n) > 1$. In this case, $\sigma_0^r$ fixes elements of the form $\{s, s+r, s+2r, ..., \}$ for any starting point $s$, which are proper subsets of $[n]$. For $y \in B_n,$ one may write $y$ as the union of full cycles and at most one tail cycle under the action of $\sigma_0^r$. Now, if $y \in B_n$ has no tail cycles under the action of $\sigma_0^r$ then $(\sigma_0^rx , \sigma_0^ry)= (\sigma_0^rx , y) \in G(x, y).$ Hence $G(x, y) \notin S_1$, and this proves the lemma. 
\end{proof}


\begin{lem} \label{lem:bounding_sublemma2} We may bound
$$\lambda_{i+1} - \lambda_i \le | \left\{ G(x, y) \in S_2(i+1) : \text{ the tail cycle in } y \text{ has at most } 2 \text{ elements}\right\}|.$$
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}

By the previous lemma, $\lambda_i = q_i - p_i$ is equal to the number of $G(x, y)$ such that there exists $r$ with $x\lessdot y,\sigma_0^r x \lessdot y$ and $y$ has a tail cycle under the action of $\sigma_0^r$ where $r < n/2$. In other words, $\lambda_i = |S_2(i)|.$ Therefore, $\lambda_{i+1} - \lambda_i = |S_2(i+1)| - |S_2(i)|$. 

Now for each $i$ we define two subsets $S_3(i) \subset S_2(i)$ and $S_4(i) \subset S_2(i)$ as follows: 
$$S_3 (i) = \left\{ G(x, y) \in S_2(i) : \text{ the tail cycle in } y \text{ has only } 2 \text{ elements}\right\};$$ and $$S_4(i)= \left\{ G(x, y) \in S_2(i) : \text{ the tail cycle in } y \text{ has at least } 3\text{ elements}\right\}.$$  

It is clear that $S_3$ and $S_4$ are disjoint subsets of $S_2$ and that $S_2 = S_3 \cup S_4$. In particular, we know that $|S_2(i+1)| = |S_3(i+1)| +|S_4(i+1)|.$ Thus $$\lambda_{i+1} - \lambda_i = |S_3(i+1)| + |S_4(i+1)| - |S_2(i)|.$$

Our goal is to show that $|S_4(i+1) | - |S_2(i)| \le 0$ and then the lemma follows.

We create an injective map $\phi$ from $S_4(i+1)$ to $S_2(i)$. For each orbit $G(x, y) \in S_4(i+1)$ with $\sigma_0^r x \lessdot y $ for some $r < n/2$, by construction we know that there is a tail cycle in $y$ which consists of at least two elements in $[n]$. Let the tail cycle be $w := \{s,s+r,s+2r,\ldots,s+lr\}$  for some $l \ge 1$, and $x = y \backslash \{s+lr\} $. We define $\phi(G(x, y)) = G(x', y')$ where $x' = x \backslash \{s\}$ and $y' = y \backslash \{s\}$. It is clear that $x' \lessdot y'$ and $\sigma_0^r x' \lessdot y'$, and that $y'$ has a tail cycle, namely $w' = \{s+r, ..., s+lr\}$. This shows that $\phi: S_4(i+1) \rightarrow S_2(i)$ is a well defined map. The map is easily seen to be injective, since on the image $\phi(S_4(i+1))$ there is a well defined right sided inverse $\phi^{-1}$, by adding an element in a similar fashion to both $x', y'$ where $G(x', y') \in \im \phi$. We remark that the map $\phi$ is not necessarily surjective. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}{\label{lem:cyclic_bounding_lambda}} 
Let $G =C_n$ and $q(i,m)$ be as defined above,  then $$\lambda_{i+1} - \lambda_i \le \sum_{\substack{k | (n , i) \\ 3 \le k }} k \cdot q \left(\frac{i}{k},\frac{n}{k}\right) .$$ 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} 


By Lemma \ref{lem:bounding_sublemma2} we need to show that $\displaystyle |S_3(i+1)| \le \sum_{\substack{d | (n , i) \\ 3 \le d }} d \cdot q \left(\frac{i}{d},\frac{n}{d}\right)  .$ 


For any $G(x, y) \in S_3(i+1)$, $y$ consists of the union of several full cycles and a tail cycle of size $2$. The full cycles in $y$ are $d$ rotationally symmetric for some $d | n$ and $d | i$ since $|y| = i+2$. We count the number of such $G(x,y)$ according to the number $d$. For each $d| (i, n)$, we define $$V_d = \left\{G(x, y) \in S_3(i+1) : \text{ the full cycles in $y$ is $d$-rotationally symmetric} \right\}.$$ Note that $V_2 = \O$, for otherwise for any $G(x, y) \in V_2$, $y$ would have only full cycles where each cycle consists of $2$ elements. Therefore, $$|S_3(i+1)| \le \displaystyle \sum_{\substack{d| (i, n) \\ 3 \le d}} |V_d|,$$ since $S_3(i+1) = \bigcup_{\substack{d| (i, n) \\ 3 \le d}} V_d$ though the union of the right hand side is in general not disjoint. 

Now we give an upper bound for $|V_d|$ for each $d | (n, i)$. Namely, we show that $|V_d| \le d \cdot q (i/d, n/d)$. It is clear that this suffices to prove the lemma.

Note that for any $G(x, y) \in V_d$, there exists some $r$ such that $\sigma_0^r x \lessdot y$, and from construction we know that $d | r$. For a given $d | (i, n)$, we consider the number of possible $G$-orbits $Gx$ such that there is some $y$ with $G(x, y) \in V_d$. By definition we know that such $x$ consists of full cycles and a tail cycle of $1$ element under $\sigma_0^r$ for any $r$ such that $d |r$, and each full cycle has $d$ elements. Let $\{s, s+d, ..., s+(n-d)\}$ be a full cycle in $x$, the number of $Gx$ is then the number of the possible ways to choose $i/d -1$ elements between $s$ and $s+d$ to form the starting points of other full cycles and $1$ additional element to form the unique tail cycle. This is precisely count the number of $G(a,b) \in \mathcal E (B_{n/d})_{i/d}$, which is $q(i/d, n/d)$ by definition. For any such $x$ as described, there is at most $d-1$ different $y$ such that $G(x,y) \in V_d$, since the rotation $r$ has to be a multiple of $d$. This finishes the proof of the lemma.
\end{proof}


\begin{thm}{\label{cor:cyclic_unimodal}} 
The poset $\mathcal E(B_n/C_n)$ is rank-symmetric and rank-unimodal.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We need to show that for $G= C_n$, the $p_i$ are unimodal. So, we only need to bound $ \displaystyle \sum_{\substack{k | (n , i)\\ 3 \le k < n/2 }} k \cdot q (\frac{i}{k}, \frac{n}{k}) $. It is clear that for sufficiently large $n$, say for $n \ge 9$, $$q((i)/k, n/k) = {n/k - 1 \choose i/k -1} \le {\lceil n/3-1 \rceil \choose \lceil i/3 -1 \rceil }.$$ Since $k \leq i,$ and $ i < n/2$, we coarsely bound the sum by $$\sum_{\substack{k | (n , i)\\ 3 \le k < n/2 }} k  \cdot {\lceil n/3-1 \rceil \choose \lceil i/3 -1 \rceil } \le \left(\frac{n}{2}\right)^2  {\lceil n/3-1 \rceil \choose \lceil i/3 -1 \rceil }. $$ We want to show that this is smaller than the difference of $$q_i - q_{i-1} = \frac{(n-1)!}{(i)! (n-i)!} - \frac{(n-1)!}{(i-1)!(n-i+1)!}= {n \choose i } \frac{n-2i}{n} \ge  {n \choose i } \frac{2}{n} .$$
Namely, we want to show that, for sufficiently large $n$, 
$$ \left(\frac{n}{2}\right)^3 \cdot {\lceil n/3-1 \rceil \choose \lceil i/3 -1 \rceil }  \le   {n \choose i}.$$

This bound works for $n$ sufficiently large. For smaller $n$ the claim can be (and has been) checked. 

Now, by Lemma \ref{lem:cyclic_bounding_lambda}, we know that $$p_{i+1} - p_{i} =  (q_{i+1} - q_i) - (\lambda_{i+1}- \lambda_i) \ge 0,$$  which proves that the $p_i$ are increasing for $i < n/2$. By symmetry, the $p_i$ are unimodal.
\end{proof}






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Dihedral  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\ssec{Quotient by the Dihedral Group}
\label{ssec:dihedral}

In this subsection, we show a similar result for the Dihedral groups that act naturally on $B_n$. Namely, for $G = D_{2n},$ the dihedral group of order $2n$, the poset $\mathcal E(B_n/G)$ is rank-symmetric and rank-unimodal.


\begin{note} In this section, we fix an arbitrary $n$ again, set $$Q = \mathcal E (B_n)/D_{2n}, \quad P = \mathcal E(B_n/D_{2n})$$ and let $$q_i = |\big( \mathcal E (B_n)/D_{2n} \big)_i|, \quad p_i = |\big( \mathcal E(B_n/D_{2n}) \big)_i|. $$ 
\end{note}

\begin{proof}
We have already seen that part $(1)$ holds trivially. We prove part $(2)$, and the proof of part $(3)$ is similar. 

We claim that given $G(x, y) \in \mathcal E (B_p)$ such that $\sigma x \lessdot y$ where $\sigma \in D_{2p}$, there exists some $\tau \in D_{2p}$ such that $\tau x = \sigma x$ and $\tau y = y$. 

The action of $D_{2p}$ on $B_p$ is induced by the action of $D_{2p}$ on $[p]$ where $[p]$ is identified with vertices of some regular $p$-polygon. Note that $D_{2p}$ is generated by the cyclic subgroup $C_p$ (corresponding to rotations of the polygon) and an arbitrary reflection $r$. In particular, any element in $D_{2p}$ is either some reflection $r$ by one of the lines of symmetry of the polygon, or some rotation $\sigma_0^{d} $ where $\sigma_0$ is the generator $\sigma_0 = (12 \cdots p)$ as defined previously in this section, and $d$ is some integer. Hence we only need to show the claim when $\sigma = r$ or $\sigma = \sigma_0^d$. It is clear that the claim holds for $\sigma = r$: if $x \lessdot y$ and $r \cdot x \lessdot y$, then it is easy to see that $r \cdot y = y$. Now suppose $\sigma_0^d \cdot x \lessdot y$ for some $G(x,y) \in \mathcal E(B_p)_i$.  Following the proof of \ref{lem:cyclicprime}, we know that $(x, y)$ is of form $x = \{s, s+d, ..., s+(i-1)d\}$ for some starting point $s \in [n]$ and $y = \{s, s+d, ..., s+(i-1)d, s + i \cdot d\}$. Now let $r_0$ be the reflection that sends $x \mapsto (2s+ i \cdot d)-x$ for all $x \in [n]$, reducing mod $n$ whenever necessary. Then $r_0$ sends $s \mapsto s+i \cdot d, s+d \mapsto s+ (i-1)d, ...$ . It is clear that $r_0 x = \sigma_0^d x$ and $r_0$ fixes $y$ by construction. This proves the claim, which by definition shows that  the action $D_{2p}$ on $B_p$ is CCT. 
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
Let $G$ be as in Proposition \ref{prop:cover_transitive_building_blocks} We remark that, in addition to unimodality, Theorem ~\ref{thm:cover_transitive_implies_Peck} implies that the poset $\mathcal E(B_n/G)$ is Peck.
\end{rem}

\begin{rem}
\label{prop:iff_dihedral_cct}
It is easy to see that if $n \neq p,n \neq 2p, n >8$ for any prime $p$, then the action of $D_{2n}$ on $B_n$ is not CCT. We give an example of a non-CCT pair. Assume $n \ne p, 2 p$ in its factorization, then $n = mk$ for some $m \ge k \ge 3$. Let us consider elements $x, y, z$ where $z$ consists of a full cycle of $k$ elements and a tail of $2$ elements. For example, $z = \{1, m+1, 2m+1, ..., (k-1)m+1, 2, m+2\}$. Let $x = z \backslash \{m+2\}$ and $y = z \backslash \{2\}$. We immediately have that $x, y \lessdot z$, and $x \in D_{2n} y$ since $x$ is sent to $y$ by the permutation $\sigma_0^m \in D_{2n}$. It is also clear that there is no $g \in D_{2n}$ translating $x$ to $y$ while fixing $z$, from the asymmetry of the element $z$. Therefore, the action of $D_{2n}$ on $B_n$ as described is CCT if and only if $n =p$ or $n = 2p$ for some prime $p$.

Hence, a complete list of $n$ for which $D_{2n}$ is $CCT$ is given by $n = p,n = 2p, n = 1, n = 8$ where $p$ varies over all primes.
\end{rem}

The following lemma gives a result for the dihedral group, which is analogous to that of Lemma \ref{lem:q_counts} for the cyclic group. It is worth noting that an alternate proof of this lemma could be given by the Redfield Polya Theorem. For further discussion of the relations of $\mathcal E$ to Polya Theory, see [\cite{reu_report}, Section 6].

\begin{lem}{\label{dihedral002}}
 We have an explicit formula for $q_i = |\big(\mathcal E (B_n)/D_{2n} \big)_i|$:
 $$q_i = \frac{1}{2} \Big( {n-1 \choose i } + \frac{1}{2} [(-1)^{n(i+1)}+1] \cdot { \lceil \frac n 2\rceil -1  \choose \lceil \frac{i+1} 2 \rceil - 1}  \Big)$$
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Consider an element $(x , y) \in \mathcal E(B_n)$ where $x \lessdot y$. Note that any element $\tau $ that fixes both $x$ and $y$ has to fix the difference $y\backslash x$, which is a one-element set. Since $G = D_{2n}$, 
we know that $1\leq |\Stab (x , y)| \leq 2$.   
Let $\mu_1$ be the number of $G$-orbits with the trivial stabilizer and $\mu_2$ be the number of $G$-orbits with the stabilizer of size $2$, which contains the identity and a reflection. By the Orbit Stabilizer Theorem, each orbit with the trivial stabilizer is of size $|D_{2n}| /1 = 2n $, while all other orbits are of size $|D_{2n}|/2 = n$.  Therefore $$\mu_1 \cdot 2n + \mu_2 \cdot n = |\{(x, y)\}| = {n \choose {i+1}}  \cdot {{i+1} \choose 1} = n {n-1 \choose i }.$$

Our goal is to calculate $q_i = \mu_1 + \mu_2$, so it remains to calculate $\mu_2$, which counts the number of $G$-orbits such that the reflection also fixes $x$. Without loss of generality, we may assume that $y\backslash x = \{1\}$. 

There are two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $n$ is odd and $i+1$ is even, then it is clear that no reflections fix $x$ for any $x$, so $\mu_2=0$. 
\item For all other cases, there are precisely $\lceil \frac n 2 -1\rceil$ places to insert $\lceil \frac {i+1} 2 - 1 \rceil$ elements of $[n]$ to form $x$. 
\end{enumerate}
This gives the desired formula $\displaystyle \mu_2 =  \frac{1}{2} [(-1)^{n(i+2)}+1] \cdot { \lceil \frac n 2\rceil -1  \choose \lceil \frac{i+1} 2 \rceil - 1}   $. Therefore, 
$$q_i = \frac{1}{2} \Big( {n-1 \choose i } + \frac{1}{2} [(-1)^{n(i+2)}+1] \cdot { \lceil \frac n 2\rceil -1  \choose \lceil \frac{i+1} 2 \rceil - 1}    \Big)$$
\end{proof}


\begin{cor}{\label{dihedral003}} 
The poset $\mathcal E(B_n/D_{2n})$ is rank-symmetric and rank-unimodal.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma \ref{lem:cyclic_bounding_lambda} and Corollary \ref{cor:cyclic_unimodal}. In fact, we can bound the difference of $\lambda_{i+1} - \lambda_i$ by precisely the same bound used in Lemma \ref{lem:cyclic_bounding_lambda}, since the difference we get here (where $G = D_{2n}$) is smaller than the previous difference (where $G= C_n$). Then, a similar proof shows that the difference of $q_{i+1} - q_i$ obtained in Lemma \ref{dihedral002} is significantly larger than the upper bound.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Unitary Peckness of E^1(B_n) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The object $\mathcal E(B_n).$}
\label{sec:unitary_peck_f}
In this section, we explicitly compute the raising operators corresponding to both \linebreak $\mathcal H(B_n),\mathcal E(B_n)$ and explicitly show that $\mathcal E(B_n)$ is unitary Peck by showing certain raising maps are invertible.

\ssec{Computation of Order Raising Maps}

In this subsection, we give explicit formulas for compositions of the order raising maps on $\mathcal H(B_n)$ and $\mathcal E(B_n)$

\begin{note}
For this section, we will use $M^{n-2i-1} = \mathcal E(U)^{n-2i-1},$ where $\mathcal E(U)^{n-2i-1}:\mathcal E(B_n)_i \rightarrow \mathcal E(B_n)_{n-i-1}$ is the Lefschetz map, as defined in ~\ref{defn:lefschetz}.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
For the remainder of this section, we take $|a| = n-i-1,|b|= n-i,|x| = i,|y| = i+1.$ Let $k = n-2i-1,$ that is, $k = |a| - |x|.$ Additionally, whenever we write an expression of the form $(x, y)$ or $(a, b),$ it is assumed that $x \lessdot y,a \lessdot b.$
\end{note}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:explicit_gbn_lefchetz}
Defining $L$ to be the Lefschetz map $\mathcal H(B_n) \rightarrow \mathcal H(B_n),$ we have $L^{n-2i-1}:\fbn^1(B_n)_i \rightarrow \fbn^1(B_n)_{n-i-1},$ and explicitly 
\begin{align*}
  L^{n-2i-1}(x, y)= k!\sum_{\substack{{y \not \subset a,}\\{x\subset a,}\\{y \subset b}}}^{}(a, b).
\end{align*}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Note that the conditions $y \not \subset a, x\subset a, y\subset b$ are equivalent to $(a, b) >_{ \mathcal H(B_n)} (x, y).$ Clearly, if $(a, b) \not >_{ \mathcal H(B_n)} (x, y),$ then the coefficient of $(a, b)$ in $  L^{n-2i-1}(x, y)$ is 0. So, to complete the proof, it suffices to show that if  $(a, b) >_{ \mathcal H(B_n)} (x, y)$ then the coefficient of $(a, b)$ in $  L^{n-2i-1}(x, y)$ is $k!$. However, this coefficient is precisely the number of sequences 
$$(x, y) = (x_0, y_0) \lessdot_{ \mathcal H(B_n)} (x_1, y_1) \lessdot_{ \mathcal H(B_n)}  \cdots \lessdot_{ \mathcal H(B_n)}  (x_k, y_k) = (a, b).$$
By definition of $ \mathcal H,$ we must have that $y_k \setminus x_k = y\setminus x$ for all $k.$ Therefore, the number of such sequences is equal to the number of sequences $x=x_0 \lessdot_{B_n} x_1 \lessdot_{B_n} \cdots \lessdot_{B_n} x_k = a,$ since choosing the $x_i$ determine $y_i$ because $y_i = x_i \cup (y \setminus x).$ Finally, the number of such sequences  
$$x=x_0 \lessdot_{B_n} x_1 \lessdot_{B_n} \cdots \lessdot_{B_n} x_k = a,$$
is equivalent to the number of ways to add the elements in $a \setminus x$ to $x$. This is because each sequence 
$$x=x_0 \lessdot_{B_n} x_1 \lessdot_{B_n} \cdots \lessdot_{B_n} x_k = a$$
is determined uniquely by the singletons $x_{i+1} \setminus x_i, 1 \leq i \leq k.$ Since in total we are adding $k$ elements to $x$ in order to obtain $a,$ there are $k!$ ways to do this. Therefore, coefficient of $(a, b)$ in $ L^{n-2i-1}(x, y)$ is $k!$
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
The map $M$ satisfies 
\begin{align*}
  M^{n-2i-1}(x, y) = (2^k - 1)(k-1)!\sum_{y \subset a}^{}(a, b) +k! \sum_{\substack{{y \not \subset a,}\\{x\subset a,}\\{y \subset b}}}^{}(a, b)
\end{align*}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}

For a particular $(x, y),(a , b)$, if either $y \subset a$ or $y \not \subset a, x\subset a, y\subset b,$ then $(a, b) \not >_{ \mathcal H(B_n)} (x, y),$ and so the coefficient of $(a, b)$ in $M^{n-2i-1}(x, y)$ is 0.

Clearly, we cannot have both $y \subset a$ and $y \not \subset a, x\subset a, y\subset b,$ hold at the same time. So, suppose  $y \not \subset a, x\subset a, y\subset b.$ This implies that $b\setminus a = y\setminus x.$ Then, the coefficient of $(a, b)$ in $M^{n-2i-1}(x, y)$ is precisely the number of sequences 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:f_seq}
(x, y) = (x_0, y_0) \lessdot_{\mathcal E(B_n)} (x_1, y_1) \lessdot_{\mathcal E(B_n)}  \cdots \lessdot_{\mathcal E(B_n)}  (x_k, y_k) = (a, b)
\end{equation}
 However, since $y \setminus x = b\setminus a,$ it must be that $y_k \setminus x_k = y\setminus x$ as well. Therefore, the number of such sequences is equal to $k!,$ as was shown in the proof of Proposition ~\ref{prop:explicit_gbn_lefchetz}.

To complete the proof, we need to show that if $y \subset a$ then the coefficient of $(a, b)$ in $M^{n-2i-1}(x, y)$ is $(2^k - 1)(k-1)!$. Equivalently, we need to show that the number of sequences as in \eqref{eqn:f_seq}
is $(2^k - 1)(k-1)!.$

For the moment, fix $j$ and consider the set of all sequences of the form in Equation ~\eqref{eqn:f_seq} such that $(a\setminus b) \cup y_{j-1} = y_j$ First, let us show the number of such with this $j$ fixed is $(k-1)!2^j.$ To do this, start by considering the number of sequence $y_0,\ldots, y_k$ such that $y=y_0 \lessdot_{B_n} y_1 \lessdot_{B_n} \cdots \lessdot_{B_n} y_k = b.$ Since we enforce $y_j = y_{j-1} \cup (a \setminus b),$ the number of such sequences is precisely the number of ways to order the elements $a \setminus y.$ Since $|y| - |a| = k-1,$ there are $(k-1)!$ such ways. Additionally, for $l <j$ we must have $x_{l+1} = x_l \cup (y_{l+1} \setminus y_l)$ or $x_{l+1} = x_l \cup (y_l \setminus x_l).$ 
Either of these is possible at every step. Additionally, for $l \geq j,$ we must have $x_{l+1} = x_l \cup (y_{l+1} \setminus y_l).$ So for any fixed sequence of $y_k$ with so that $j$ is minimal with $(a\setminus b) \in y_j,$ 
there are precisely $2^{j-1}$ possible sequences 
$$x=x_0 \lessdot_{B_n} x_1 \lessdot_{B_n} \cdots \lessdot_{B_n} x_k = a$$
so that 
$$(x, y) = (x_0, y_0) \lessdot_{\mathcal E(B_n)} (x_1, y_1) \lessdot_{\mathcal E(B_n)}  \cdots \lessdot_{\mathcal E(B_n)}  (x_k, y_k) = (a, b).$$

So, in total, there are $2^j(k-1)!$ sequences of the form in ~\eqref{eqn:f_seq} with $(a\setminus b) \cup y_{j-1} = y_j$. Now, there clearly must be some such $j,1 \leq j \leq k.$ Therefore, the coefficient we are looking for is 
$$\sum_{j = 1}^k 2^{j-1}(k-1)! = (2^k - 1)(k-1)!,$$
as claimed.

\end{proof}



\ssec{Proof that $\mathcal E(B_n)$ is unitary Peck}

In this subsection, we will show the rows of $M$ form a basis by showing we can make a change of basis to a map which is takes $M^{n-2i-1}$ to $L^{n-2i-1}.$ Since we know $L^{n-2i-1}$ is an isomorphism, it will follow that $M^{n-2i-1}$ is as well.

  &= \sum_{b\subset s,a \subset b}^{} \beta \sum_{y \subset a}^{}(x, y) + \sum_{b\subset s,a \subset b}^{} \sum_{y\subset b,x \subset a,y\not\subset a}^{}(x, y).\\
  &= \beta\binom {|s|-i-1}{n-2i-2}(|s|-n+i+1) \sum_{y \subset s}^{}(x ,y)+ \sum_{b\subset s,a \subset b}^{} \sum_{y\subset b,x \subset a,y\not\subset a}^{}(x, y).\\
  &= \beta\binom {|s|-i-1}{n-2i-2}(|s|-n+i+1) \sum_{y \subset s}^{}(x ,y) + \binom{|s|-i-1}{n-2i-1}\sum_{y\subset s}^{}(x, y)\\
  & =\left(\frac{1}{\beta\binom {|s|-i-1}{n-2i-2}(|s|-n+i+1)+\binom{|s|-i-1}{n-2i-1}}\right) \sum_{y \subset s}^{}(x,y).
\end{align*}
In going between the fourth line and the fifth line, one needs to count the number of $y$ satisfying $y \subset a \subset b\subset s.$ If we fix $s,a$ there are $(|s|-n+i+1)$ choices for the element $b,$ since $b = a \cup \{s\}$ for $s \notin a.$ Then, we need to count the number of $a$ with $y \subset a \subset s.$ This is exactly $\binom {|s|-i-1}{n-2i-2}.$ Hence, the total of number of such $y$ is the product $\binom {|s|-i-1}{n-2i-2}(|s|-n+i+1).$

In going from the fifth line to the sixth line, for $y,s$ fixed, we count the number of $b$ with $y \subset b \subset s.$ This is exactly $\binom{|s|-i-1}{n-2i-1}$.

\end{align*}
The penultimate line is equal to the ultimate line because any element $(x, y)$ with $x \subset s$ must either have $y \subset s$ or else $y \subset s \cup \{t\}$ for $t \notin s.$ The two terms on the penultimate line cover precisely these two cases.

Using ~\ref{z_equivalence} and ~\ref{u_equivalence}
\begin{align*}
  h_s &= z_{[n]} - u_s \\
  &= \sum_{x\subset y}^{}(x, y)-\sum_{x\subset s,x\subset y}^{}(x, y)\\
  &= \sum_{x\not\subset s}^{}(x, y)
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
\begin{note}
For $I \subset[n],$ let $I^c = [n]\setminus I,$ the complement of $I$ in $[n].$
\end{note}

\begin{lem}
\label{l_induction_step}
Let $I$ be fixed. If $l_J$ lies in the span of $v_{(a, b)}$ for $J \subset I,$ then so does $l_I.$

\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $I = \{i_1,\ldots, i_s\}.$ Let $A_k = \{x \colon i_k \in x\}.$ Then, $\cap_{k=1}^s A_k = \{x \colon I \subset x\}.$ Using the principle of inclusion exclusion, we can write $\sum_{x \in\cap_{k=1}^s A_k} (x, y)$ as a sum of terms $\pm \sum_{x \in\cap_{k \in J} A_k} (x, y),$ for $J \subset I.$ Since we are assuming $\pm \sum_{x \in\cap_{k \in J} A_k} (x, y),$ lie in the span of $v_{(a, b)}$ it follows that $l_I = \sum_{x \in\cap_{k=1}^s A_k} (x, y)$ does as well.

\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
For all $J \subset [n],$ with $|J| \leq i,$ we have $l_{J}$ lies in the span of $v_{(a , b)}.$ 
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
We prove this by induction on the size of $I.$ First, we know $h_{[n]}$ lies in the span of $v_{(a, b)}$ and so have completed the base case $|I| = 0$ since $h_{[n]} = l_{\emptyset}.$ So, to complete the proof, it suffices to show that if we know this Lemma holds for all $|s|>j$ then it holds for $|s| = j.$  This is exactly what ~\ref{l_induction_step} proves.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
\label{l_diag_equivalence}
For $|x| = i,$ we have $l_{x} = \sum_{y \supset x}^{}(y, x).$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
By definition, $l_{\bar x} = \sum_{\bar x\subset x,\bar x \cap x = \bar x,x\subset y}^{}(x, y) = \sum_{\bar x\subset y}^{}(\bar x, y).$ Replacing $\bar x$ by $x$ gives the result.
\end{proof}

\begin{note}
Define $m_a = \sum_{x \subset a}^{}l_{x}.$
\end{note}

\begin{lem}
\label{m_equivalence}
With $m_a$ as defined above, we have $m_a = \sum_{x\subset a}^{}(x, y).$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
By ~\ref{l_diag_equivalence}, we obtain
$$m_a = \sum_{x \subset a}^{}l_{x} = \sum_{x \subset a}^{}\sum_{y \supset x}^{}(x,y)= \sum_{x\subset a}^{}(x, y)$$
\end{proof}

\begin{note}
Denote $r_a = \sum_{b,b\subset a}^{} v_{(a, b)}.$
\end{note}

\begin{lem}
\label{r_equivalence}
With $r_a$ as defined above, we have 
$$r_a = ((i+1)\beta-1)\sum_{y\subset a}^{}(x, y) +\sum_{x\subset a}^{}(x,y).$$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
\begin{align*}
  r_a &= \sum_{b\supset a}^{}v_{(a, b)}\\
  &=\sum_{b\supset a}^{} \left(\beta \sum_{y \subset a}^{}(x, y) + \sum_{\substack{{y\subset b,}\\{x \subset a,}\\{y\not\subset a}}}^{}(x, y).\right)\\
  &= \sum_{b\supset a}^{} \beta \sum_{y \subset a}^{}(x, y) + \sum_{b\supset a}^{} \sum_{\substack{{y\subset b,}\\{x \subset a,}\\{y\not\subset a}}}^{}(x, y).\\
  &= (i+1)\beta \sum_{y \subset a}^{}(x, y) + \sum_{b\supset a}^{} \sum_{\substack{{y\subset b,}\\{x \subset a,}\\{y\not\subset a}}}^{}(x, y).\\
  &= (i+1)\beta \sum_{y \subset a}^{}(x, y) + \sum_{x \subset a,y\not\subset a}^{}(x, y).\\
  &= ((i+1)\beta-1) \sum_{y \subset a}^{}(x, y) + \left( \sum_{x \subset a,y\not\subset a}^{}(x, y)+\sum_{y \subset a}^{}(x, y)\right).\\
  &= ((i+1)\beta-1) \sum_{y \subset a}^{}(x, y) + \sum_{x \subset a}^{}(x, y).\\
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
\begin{note}
Assuming we do not have $(i+1)\beta = 1,$ define $t_a = \frac{r_a - m_a}{(i+1)\beta - 1}$
\end{note}

\begin{lem}
\label{t_equivalence}
With $t_a$ as defined above, $t_a= \sum_{y\subset a}^{}(x, y) $
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
By ~\ref{r_equivalence} and ~\ref{m_equivalence}, we have
\begin{align*}
  t_a &= \frac{r_a - m_a}{(i+1)\beta - 1}\\
  &= \frac{((i+1)\beta-1)\sum_{y\subset a}^{}(x, y) +\sum_{x\subset a}^{}(x, y)-\sum_{x\subset a}^{}(x, y) }{(i+1)\beta - 1}\\
  &= \frac{((i+1)\beta-1)\sum_{y\subset a}^{}(x, y)}{(i+1)\beta - 1}\\
  &= \sum_{y\subset a}^{}(x, y)
\end{align*}
\end{proof}



\begin{note}
Assuming $\beta(i+1) \neq 1,$ let $q_{a,b} = v_{(a, b)} - \beta t_a.$
\end{note}

\begin{lem}
We have $q_{a,b} = \sum_{\substack{{y\subset b,}\\{x \subset a,}\\{y\not\subset a}}}^{}(x, y).$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Using ~\ref{t_equivalence}
\begin{align*}
  q_{a,b} &= v_{(a, b)} - \beta t_a \\
  &= \beta \sum_{y \subset a}^{}(x, y) + \sum_{\substack{{y\subset b,}\\{x \subset a,}\\{y\not\subset a}}}^{}(x, y) - \beta\sum_{y\subset a}^{}(x, y)\\
  &= \sum_{\substack{{y\subset b,}\\{x \subset a,}\\{y\not\subset a}}}^{}(x, y)
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:invertibility_lefschetz}
For $n >2,$ the matrix $M^{n-2i-1}$ is invertible.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
We saw that if $\beta(i+1) \neq 1,$ we have that $q_{a,b} = \sum_{\substack{{y\subset b,}\\{x \subset a,}\\{y\not\subset a}}}^{}(x, y)$ lie in the span of $v_{(a, b)}.$ It is always the case that $\beta \geq 1,i \geq 0.$ The only time in which $\beta = 1,i=0$ is when $n = 2.$ Therefore, $q_{a,b}$ are always defined for $n > 2.$ However, $q_{a,b}$ are exactly the rows of $L^{n-2i-1}$ as defined in Proposition \ref{prop:explicit_gbn_lefchetz}. Using Corollary ~\ref{cor:HBn_unitary_peck}, we know $\mathcal H(B_n)$ is unitary Peck, and therefore the rows of $L^{n-2i-1}$ are independent. Therefore, the rows of $M^{n-2i-1}$ span an independent set in a vector space of the same dimension. So, the rows of $M^{n-2i-1}$ are independent. Hence, $M^{n-2i-1}$ is indeed an isomorphism, when $n > 2.$
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
\label{cor:unitary_peck_edge_bn}
The poset $\mathcal E(B_n)$ is unitary Peck.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
By definition, a poset $P,\rk(P) = t$ is unitary peck if and only if the Lefschetz map $L:P \rightarrow P,x \mapsto \sum_{y \gtrdot x} y,$ satisfies $L^{t-2i}:P_i \rightarrow P_{t-i}$ is an isomorphism. In the case $P = \mathcal E(B_n),\rk(P) = n-1,$ we have that $M$ is the Lefschetz map and by Theorem ~\ref{thm:invertibility_lefschetz}, $M^{n-1-2i}:\mathcal E(B_n)_i \rightarrow \mathcal E(B_n)_{n-1-i}$ is indeed an isomorphism. Hence, $\mathcal E(B_n)$ is unitary Peck.
\end{proof}

\ssec{Further Questions}

\sssec{Category Theoretic Properties}

First, it is worth noting that the functor $\mathcal E:\mathcal P \rightarrow \mathcal P$ is neither essentially surjective nor injective on objects. Let $P$ be the poset with points $a,b,c,d$ and relations $a \lessdot c, b \lessdot c, a \lessdot d.$ It is easy to see there is no poset $A$ with $\mathcal E(A) = P.$ This shows $\mathcal E$ is not essentially surjective. Next, let $Q$ be the poset whose elements are $e,f,g$ with $e \lessdot f, e \lessdot g,$ and let $R$ be the poset whose elements are $h,i,j,k$ with $h \lessdot i, j \lessdot k.$ It is clear that $\mathcal E(Q) \cong \mathcal E(R)$ are both a disjoint union of two points, but $Q \not \cong R.$ So, $\mathcal E$ is also not injective on objects.

However, there are many aspects of the functor $\mathcal E,$ which are still unexplored. First, note that it is worth noting that $\mathcal E$ also determines a endofunctor on the category of posets (even those without a grading), which we now notate $\mathcal Q,$ as well as an endofunctor on the category of graded posets $\mathcal P.$ In general, the points of a poset $P$ can be identified with the set $Hom_{\mathcal Q}(B_0,P),$ and the edges of $P$ can be identified with the set $Hom_{\mathcal Q}(B_1,P).$ It is simple to see additionally that the points of $\mathcal E(P)$ are $Hom_{\mathcal Q}(B_0,\mathcal E(P)) \cong Hom_{\mathcal Q}(B_1,P).$ Additionally, the edges of $\mathcal E(P)$ are $Hom_{\mathcal Q}(B_1,\mathcal E(P)) \cong Hom_{\mathcal Q}(B_2,P).$ These relations may be a reasonable alternate way to think of the functor of edges, and are further suggestive of the existence of an adjoint functor.

\begin{question}
Does the functor $\mathcal E$ have a left or right adjoint?
\end{question}

\sssec{Unitary Peck Generalizations}

Additionally, there are several posets which we would like to be unitary  
Peck, as this would allow us to apply much of the theory developed in this paper. They would also make several of the generalizations of $\mathcal E$ potentially more interesting.

As mentioned in the introduction, a natural extension of Conjecture ~\ref{conj:F_of_BnG_Peck} would be an analogous result for q-analogs. We suspect that a proof similar to that of Corollary ~\ref{cor:unitary_peck_edge_bn} may also prove Question ~\ref{question:unitary_peck_q_edge}.

\begin{defn}
Let $B_n(q)$ be the graded poset whose elements are linear subspaces $V \subset \mathbb F_q^n$ with $V \leq W$ if $V \subset W.$
\end{defn}

\begin{question}
\label{question:unitary_peck_q_edge}
Is $\mathcal E(B_n(q))$ unitary peck?
\end{question}

\sssec{A $q$-analog of Conjecture ~\ref{conj:F_of_BnG_Peck}}

In particular, if the answer to the previous Question ~\ref{question:unitary_peck_q_edge} is affirmative, it would immediately hold that $\mathcal E(B_n(q))/G$ is Peck, and if $G$ is CCT then $\mathcal E(B_n(q)/G)$ is Peck. Hence, we pose the following question: 

\begin{question}
For $G$ a group with a CCT action on $B_n(q)$ is $\mathcal E(B_n(q)/G)$ Peck?
\end{question}

Even more generally, we wonder if the q-analog of Conjecture ~\ref{conj:F_of_BnG_Peck} holds.

\begin{question}
For $G$ a group acting on $B_n(q)$, is $\mathcal E(B_n(q)/G)$ Peck? If not, is $\mathcal E(B_n(q)/G)$ rank-unimodal?
\end{question}

\sssec{Additional CCT Actions}

We also found several additional interesting examples of CCT actions, and we are curious whether they generalize. Once such action is the linear automorphism of the $n$-cube. Using computers, we found that for $n \leq 3,$ the linear automorphisms of the $n$-cube induces a CCT action on $B_{2^n}$. We wonder if this generalizes.

\begin{question}
\label{question:cube_cct}
Does the group of linear automorphism of an $n$-cube in $\mathbb R^n$, whose vertices lie at $(\pm 1, \ldots, \pm 1)$ induce a CCT action on $B^{2^n}$?
\end{question}

There is also the question of which exceptional regular polytopes induce CCT actions. We have shown it holds for the octahedron, the simplex (tetrahedron) in Subsubsection \ref{sssec:polytopes}. We also checked using the computer that it holds for the cube. We wonder whether it holds for all exceptional regular polytopes.

\begin{question}
\label{question:exceptional_polytopes_cct}
Do the remaining five exceptional regular polytopes (namely the dodecahedron and icosahedron in $\mathbb R^3$ as well as the $24$-cell, $120$-cell, and $600$-cell polytopes in $\mathbb R^4$) induce CCT actions?
\end{question}

Also, we found using computers that the group of invertible linear maps on $\mathbb F_2^3$ acting on the the seven nonzero points of $\mathbb F_2^3$ induce an action on $B_7$ which is CCT. We wonder if this generalizes to other groups of invertible linear maps on finite fields.

\begin{question}
Is the action of $GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ on $B_{q^n-1}$ (induced by the action of $GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ on $(\mathbb F_q^n)^\times$) CCT? What about the action of $PGL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ on $B_n(q)?$ If not, what about the action of $PGL_n(\mathbb F_2)$ on $B_n(2)?$ 
\end{question}
