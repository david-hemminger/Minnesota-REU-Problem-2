\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Please note: This paragraph does NOT currently reflect reality. I thought for a while about how we should structure the paper, and this is roughly how I think it should look.}{4}{section*.8}

\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Obviously come back to this at the end, but since this is the introduction for the REU report, not a journal paper, we should also include descriptions of the sections we don't think will go in the journal paper.}{4}{section*.11}

\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ I don't think the details of the proof need to be included here, but I've left them here commented out in case we change our minds. Aaron: I agree it is fine to leave them out.}{6}{section*.13}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Put all pictures in figures, and make them look nicer}{8}{section*.14}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ David, can you fill this in please?}{11}{section*.15}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ $ |\EuScript E^1(B_n/C_n)|_{i}$ should probably be notated as $ |\EuScript E^1(B_n/C_n)_{i}|$, since it is the size of the $i$th rank of the poset. You should check to make sure you did not do this anywhere else (it is also done in the q-analog case, currently in \nobreakspace \ref {q:number_subspaces}, for instance) }{24}{section*.16}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ It might be clearer to say: fix $P(n) = \EuScript E^1(B_n)/C_n,Q(n) = \EuScript E^1(B_n/C_n),$ and notate $p(i,n) = |P(n)_i|,q(i,n) = |Q(n)_i|.$ When the $n$ is clear, we shall write $p_i,q_i$ for $p(i,n),q(i,n).$}{24}{section*.17}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Perhaps consider writing $(P)_i$ instead of $[P]_i$ for the $i$th rank of $P.$ Above I used the notation $[f(x,y)]_x^a$ for the coefficient of $x^a$ in $f(x,y),$ and we have also been using parentheses above for this. Again, this is something that appears several times in this and the next section, and if you agree, you should make sure to change it everywhere.}{24}{section*.18}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Perhaps the word ``1-click'' isn't really necessary, (although I agree it's important to fix $\sigma _0$ since you only use ``1-click'' rotation one or two times, and it might be clearer to say something about $\sigma _0^dy$ rather than something about the $d$-click rotation of y. Additionally, you don't define $d$-click rotation anywhere, but again, I don't think you should use this work ``click'' at all, even though I know you like thinking in these terms.}{24}{section*.19}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ maybe we should make different notation for this, something like $(G\times G)(x, y),$ instead of abusing notation. I put this as a notation because it is used later in lemma 11.0.14 as well}{24}{section*.20}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Fixed issue in my version, hasn't pushed yet}{24}{section*.21}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ what is $A_i.$ I think you may mean $\EuScript E^1(B_n)_i?$}{24}{section*.22}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ again, consider changing brackets to parentheses, although I'll stop pointing this out}{24}{section*.23}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Probably it would be best to put the lemma later saying there are at most two $G(x,y)$ in the same $(Gx, Gy).$ If you don't want to do this, you might have to say that there are at most 2 $G$ orbits in the same $G\times G$ orbit (which is non-obvious, and very special to the cyclic group.) I think you really need to put this paragraph after the next paragraph.}{24}{section*.24}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ I think (i.e...) actually makes things more confusing, rather than clearer. Consider removing the clause after i.e.?}{24}{section*.25}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ It seems like there is never a proof of this lemma, although presumably you mean to put it right above \nobreakspace \ref {cor:cyclic_unimodal}. It might also be a little confusing to state this lemma in its precise form here, and why it implies unimodality, since it seems to be the same as \nobreakspace \ref {cor:cyclic_unimodal}. Consider removing this lemma here, and saying the goal in this section is to prove \nobreakspace \ref {cor:cyclic_unimodal}.}{25}{section*.26}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Perhaps define this together with $p_i$ above, since $p_i$ really depend on $n$ as well? See the comment on your definition of $p_i,q_i.$}{25}{section*.27}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Perhaps put this lemma above \nobreakspace \ref {lem:cyclicprime} because then you don't have to say there are at most two special orbits in the same orbit in that proof.}{25}{section*.28}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ I don't think you need to say let $q_i,p_i$ be defined as usual}{25}{section*.29}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ inconsistent notation for size of a set, change $\#$ to $|*|.$}{25}{section*.30}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Consider using a word other than special? Maybe you could say a double orbit, or something like that?}{25}{section*.31}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Perhaps consider breaking this proof into a couple lemmas. First I might say that $\lambda _{i+1} - \lambda _i$ is bounded by the number of elements $y$ with tail cycles with respect to some $\sigma _0^r$ so that $y \lessdot y'$ with $y' \in Stab(\sigma _0^r).$ Then, I would give the bound in the statement of this lemma regarding the size of this set.}{25}{section*.32}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ I don't understand what it means by an orbit ``contributes to the difference.'' What you really want to say is that an orbit is in a certain set, and the difference is the size of that set. I have edited the previous paragraphs to make this clearer, can you fix the rest of the proof please?}{26}{section*.33}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Elise: does this mean $\lambda _{i+1} - \lambda _{i}\not =0$?}{26}{section*.34}

\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ What does this mean? It sounds like you're thinking of $\lambda _i$ as a variable, which changes size as you look at different $G$ orbits.}{26}{section*.37}
