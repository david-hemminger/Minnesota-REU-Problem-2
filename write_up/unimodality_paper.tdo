\contentsline {todo}{\color@box {}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ V: You probably mean if the irreducible polynomial f(x) over $F_q$ divides $x^{q^i}-x$, not what you wrote. I would probably just quickly remind the reader why it's true: such a polynomial f(x) is the minimal polynomial for some element a of $F_{q^i}$, and hence F(a) is a subfield of $F_{q^i}$, so of the form $F_{q^d}$ with d dividing i, but then d is the degree of f(x). Another (nearly equivalent) way to phrase the proof of Lemma 9.3 goes like this. If V is a k-dimensional $F_q$-subspace of $F_{q^n}$ which is stabilized by an element a in $F_{q^n}^x$, then V is actually an F(a)-subspace. Hence if d is the unique positive integer for which $F(a) = F_{q^d}$, then d divides k (because d is the dimension of F(a) over $F_q$ while k is the dimension of V over $F_q$). But then in the setting of Lemma 9.3, one has d dividing both i and i+1, so d=1, i.e. the element a actually lies in $F_q$.}{38}{section*.7}
