\contentsline {todo}{\color@box {}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ Following the example of Theorem 1.5 on p. 7, Proposition 4.3 on p. 10 should be renumbered as Proposition 1.7 and Proposition 4.22 on p. 14 should be renumbered as Proposition 1.6 It appears that theorem tools allows us to renumber the theorems but not the propositions, or at least I haven't figured out how. I'd suggest just calling the repeated propositions ``Theorems'', or else one of you can take a try at figuring out how to repeat the number of the first proposition. -Aaron}{3}

When you write definitions of group actions in your compact form, the agglomeration of symbols is nearly unreadable . (It would also be helpful if you avoided beginning sentences or dependent clauses with mathematical symbols.) -- Placed at the top because I think there's likely multiple places in the paper where this is done - David Is proposition 4.4 readable now? -- Zijian}{3}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@box {}{orange}{\leavevmode {\color {orange}o}}\ p. 7 line 43 - It would be helpful to put the REU report in the references and cite it throughout the paper, so that in other parts of the paper, the reader doesn't have to know about the footnote in order to be able to find the url. You can still say 'the REU report' throughout the paper, but put the citation after it. -- Wasn't there a reason why we didn't do this in the first place? Was it because Order doesn't want us to cite things that aren't peer-reviewed? - David It says in the instructions: The list of references should only include works that are cited in the text and that have been published or accepted for publication. Personal communications and unpublished works should only be mentioned in the text. Do not use footnotes or endnotes as a substitute for a reference list. What should we do? -Aaron I would follow the advice of citing the REU report, but mention that it is not published to the reviewers/editor -- if they are not happy with that, we change it back. -- if we agree then this could be done in next editing - Z }{3}
