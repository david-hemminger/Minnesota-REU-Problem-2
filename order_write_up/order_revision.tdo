You can still say 'the REU report' throughout the paper, but put the citation after it. -- Wasn't there a reason why we didn't do this in the first place? Was it because Order doesn't want us to cite things that aren't peer-reviewed? - David It says in the instructions: The list of references should only include works that are cited in the text and that have been published or accepted for publication. Personal communications and unpublished works should only be mentioned in the text. Do not use footnotes or endnotes as a substitute for a reference list. What should we do? -Aaron I would follow the advice of citing the REU report, but mention that it is not published to the reviewers/editor -- if they are not happy with that, we change it back. -- if we agree then this could be done in next editing - Z Ok, I am happy to follow their advice then. I think we should make a comment in our responses about why we did this, though}{2}

But, if you feel strongly, feel free to delete it.}{5}
