For any graded poset $P$, we define a new graded poset, $\mathcal E(P)$, whose elements are the edges in the Hasse diagram of P. For any group, $G$, acting on the boolean algebra, $B_n$, we conjecture that $\mathcal E(B_n/G)$ is Peck. We prove that the conjecture holds for ``common cover transitive'' actions. We give some infinite families of common cover transitive actions and show that the common cover transitive actions are closed under direct and semidirect products.
